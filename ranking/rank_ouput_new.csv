Sometimes, these are referred to as &lsquo;everyday accounts&rsquo;, because they can be used to aid you in your everyday spending, from your morning coffee to your mortgage payment.</p>\n<p>Often, a bank account will send you a debit card that can be used to withdraw cash at ATMs or pay for everyday expenses. While many people choose to have their salary paid automatically into their bank account, you can also deposit money manually if you choose.</p>\n<h3>What are the benefits of opening a bank account?</h3>\n<p>The biggest benefit to opening a bank or transaction account is that it provides you with a safe space to store your money for convenient use. It gives you a place to deposit new funds and also helps you easily pay for your purchases.</p>\n<p>Transaction accounts are also helpful in tracking your spending. Many bank accounts allow you to view all of your recent purchases, so it&rsquo;s easy to see where your money has been going. If you&rsquo;re someone who tends to spend as much or more than they earn, a bank account can help you see exactly what you&rsquo;re buying to help you manage your funds more carefully.</p>\n<h3>When should you open a bank account?</h3>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no right or wrong time to open a bank account. Many parents choose to open <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/childrens"">children&rsquo;s savings account</a> for their little ones, but the right time to open a transaction account may be when you begin to make an income or are responsible for your own spending.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to manage your money that&rsquo;s convenient and helps you with your daily spending, then it might be time to open a bank account. With your bank account, you&rsquo;ll be able to spend, deposit and withdraw as you please.</p>\n<h3>Can you open a bank account online?</h3>\n<p>Many banks allow customers to apply for a bank account entirely online. Typically, you&rsquo;ll be required to submit forms of ID as well as personal details, so be sure you have access to a document scanner. You may also be asked to sign an application that is posted to you or which you&rsquo;ve printed. After you&rsquo;ve signed the document, it should be taken to a branch of your chosen bank.</p>\n<p>Online applications vary from bank to bank, so be sure to pay special attention to your bank&rsquo;s instructions as you apply.</p>\n<h3>Do bank accounts charge fees?</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll find that most transaction accounts have some associated fees. These may be as small as an ATM fee that only applies when using non-affiliated ATMs, but there are other fees you should look out for. Some transaction accounts may charge a monthly fee. If you&rsquo;re looking for a low-fee account, it may be best to avoid accounts with monthly fees.</p>\n<p>Other fees may include branch withdrawal fees or cheque deposit fees. Before choosing a bank account, make sure that the fees are suited to your lifestyle.</p>\n<h3>What should you look for when choosing a bank account?</h3>\n<p>While bank accounts usually function similarly, there are differences between bank accounts. Finding the best bank account for you is a matter of your lifestyle and spending habits.</p>\n<p>One thing to consider when choosing a bank account is how convenient it is to withdraw money. Does this bank have ATMs near your home? Would it be convenient for you to seek out an ATM or bank branch for withdrawing cash?</p>\n<p>Knowing how and where you can get cash out could help you find the best bank accounts for your daily life.</p>\n<p>Another aspect to consider is online access. If you would rather deal with your finances online rather than inside a bank branch, then you might look for a transaction account that allows you online access. Many banks have mobile apps that allow you to view transactions, check your balance and transfer money to other accounts.</p>\n<p>You should also be aware of any fees that your chosen transaction account charges. You may think that the best bank accounts have zero fees, but most transaction accounts with have small fees attached. Some bank accounts charge a monthly fee for the convenience of having an account; others may charge a withdrawal fee or cheque deposit fee. Some accounts also charge for paper statements, so you can save a little money by opting for online statements only.</p>",,320,1,44,1,151,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,54.35,264.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Bank Accounts that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p><span>Most people don&rsquo;t put a lot of thought into their everyday bank account. That is a shame, because comparing the cheapest bank accounts can be a handy way to find a bank account which minimises unnecessary fees and charges, while qualifying for a range of perks and extras. </span></p>\n<p><span>We&rsquo;re going to look at the different types of everyday transaction accounts available, what distinguishes these bank accounts from other options and the sort of things you should be looking for when comparing bank accounts. </span></p>\n<h3>What type of bank accounts are available?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Transaction accounts &ndash;</span></strong><span> These bank accounts are designed to make meeting day-to-day expenses easy. Transaction accounts are set up to make it easy for people to receive their pay, take out cash and pay any bills that have arrived. While these bank accounts are highly accessible, they generally don&rsquo;t offer a great interest rate return and sometimes have numerous bank account fees and charges that the account holder should be wary of. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Savings accounts &ndash;</span></strong><span> On the other end of the spectrum you&rsquo;ve got savings accounts, which are designed to give people a place where they can put their money and make it grow faster. Savings accounts typically offer a superior interest rate to regular transaction accounts, and some have measures in place that make it harder to access your money, theoretically making it easier to set your funds aside and save. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Joint bank accounts &ndash;</span></strong><span> This is a bank account that has two names on it, and is an account that is generally opened by people in a relationship. There are advantages to opening joint bank accounts, like lowering account fees, but there are also inherent risks involved.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the advantages of a transaction account?</h3>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re testing the market, and comparing the cheapest bank accounts to find the best option, it&rsquo;s useful to be aware of the advantages an everyday transaction account offers for users. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Easy-to-use and accessible &ndash;</span></strong><span> Perhaps the chief advantage of an everyday transaction account is the fact that it&rsquo;s easy to use, and highly accessible. If you&rsquo;ve got a bill to pay or need a place where you can receive your wages, a regular transaction account generally gets the job done, making it easy to manage your money and meet day-to-day expenses. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>They&rsquo;re often free to open &ndash;</span></strong><span> Rules change from provider to provider, but most everyday bank accounts are free to open. This allows you to get started with your new bank account, without having to worry about being slugged with fees straight off the bat. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>No lock-in period &ndash;</span></strong><span> Most people don&rsquo;t shop around for the cheapest bank account, but it&rsquo;s easier than you might think. Many institutions offer bank accounts with no lock-in periods, which can be useful for people looking to shop around for a better deal. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Your money is safe &ndash;</span></strong><span> A bank account is one of the safest places to keep your money. Should the unthinkable happen and the financial institution you&rsquo;re banking with somehow goes bust, the Australian government will guarantee your savings account balance up to the value of $250,000, which can provide some peace of mind in times of volatility.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the disadvantages of a transaction account?</h3>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re comparing the cheapest bank accounts and looking to find the right one for your situation, it&rsquo;s equally as important to be aware of the disadvantages of a transaction account. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Interest rates are variable &ndash;</span></strong><span> While they take some guidance from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), banks and financial institutions are free to change their interest rates whenever they like. This could cause problems for people who want a bank account that can give them the potential to grow their money, while managing their day-to-day expenses. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Interest rates are lower than savings accounts &ndash;</span></strong><span> What&rsquo;s also true is that interest rates offered by traditional transaction accounts are generally lower than those offered by savings accounts. So even if you have found the cheapest bank account available, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;re in a good position to grow and expand your wealth. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Paying multiple fees &ndash;</span></strong><span> Another one of the main sticking points that comes with people opening transaction bank accounts is the fees payable. While the nature and amount of these fees vary from provider to provider, bank account holders can often lose a significant portion of their savings paying fees that in some cases they&rsquo;re not even aware of. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Temptation to spend &ndash;</span></strong><span> Having money that&rsquo;s easily accessible is convenient, but it can also be very tempting. The ease with which transaction bank account holders can access their funds can sometimes result in people making unnecessary discretionary purchases, which over the course of time can make it more difficult for savers to meet their long-term financial goals. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What sort of fees will I have to pay with a transaction account?</h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re comparing the market, and looking to find the cheapest banking account in Australia, it&rsquo;s important to be wary of the sort of fees these bank accounts commonly put upon customers:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Monthly account-keeping fees &ndash;</span></strong><span> These are fees charged by your bank or financial institution that are designed to cover the day-to-day administration and upkeep of your account.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Phone banking fees &ndash;</span></strong><span> If you&rsquo;re someone who likes to bank over the phone, your use of this banking feature might incur an additional level of fee from your provider. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Internet banking fees &ndash;</span></strong><span> By the same token, if you&rsquo;re undertaking internet banking, you may be incurring additional charges from your bank or financial institute. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Overdraft charges &ndash;</span></strong><span> Some banks and financial institutions will penalise account holders for overdrawing on their bank account balance. It&rsquo;s always important to be aware of your bank&rsquo;s policy on overdrafts, and whether they impose additional charges when this occurs.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Transaction fees &ndash;</span></strong><span> Depending on your provider and the nature of the transaction you wish to undertake, you may also incur separate transaction fees you have to pay. Again, it&rsquo;s important to be aware of your bank&rsquo;s policy when comparing bank accounts. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What should I look for when choosing a transaction account?</h3>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re comparing cheapest bank accounts in Australia and looking for the right one that fits your situation, it&rsquo;s important to consider the following aspects and traits. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Are the fees low? </span></strong><span>Bank accounts with low fees generally ensure that the bank account holder has more money at the end of the day. Make sure you compare bank accounts by fees, to make sure you&rsquo;re not needlessly digging into the money you&rsquo;ve saved to cover unnecessary charges. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Does your bank have minimum and maximum account balances?</span></strong><span> Be wary if your bank imposes charges for going under or over any minimum or maximum balances. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>What sort of access does it offer?</span></strong><span> When comparing transaction accounts, it&rsquo;s important to be aware of the different levels of access offered, to make sure you&rsquo;ve got the right bank account to meet your day-to-day expenses, while keeping your funds safe.</span></li>\n</ul>",,20,2,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,3.0,453.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Bank Accounts that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p>If you manage most of your incoming and outgoing money through an everyday bank account, you might be wondering if you can earn a decent amount of interest on a standard transaction account.</p>\n<p>While some transaction accounts come with a higher-than-average interest rate, these rates still tend to be lower than the interest rates available on savings accounts.</p>\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the difference between a transaction account and a savings account?</h3>\n<p>A transaction account, also known simply as a &lsquo;bank account&rsquo;, is a standard account used for day-to-day expenses. This is typically the account that you have your salary paid into and use to pay bills. You can access funds using a debit or credit card, and usually don&rsquo;t have to pay any fees for ATM withdrawals or transfers.</p>\n<p>A savings account is designed to help you save over the long term and allow you to earn interest on the money you&rsquo;ve deposited into the account. Typically, they offer a higher interest rate than a standard transaction account.</p>\n<p>Savings accounts often carry withdrawal fees and monthly withdrawal limits to encourage you to save. This is also advantageous for banks, because they can use customers&rsquo; savings deposits to balance their books when lending money to other customers.</p>\n<h3>How do bank account interest rates work?</h3>\n<p>Banks set interest rates based largely (although not entirely) on the Reserve Bank of Australia&rsquo;s cash rate. Usually, a lower cash rate equals a lower interest rate on your savings account.</p>\n<p>Some high-interest bank accounts earn compound interest, which means you earn interest on the money you have deposited as well as the interest you&rsquo;ve earned. Other accounts earn simple interest, which means you only earn interest at the end of a specified term.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to check how often interest accrues on a bank account, because a compound interest account will yield higher returns over time.</p>\n<p>For example, if you invest $8,000 for three years at 5 per cent per year, with simple interest paid at the end of the term, you would earn $1,200 in interest ($400 each year), giving you a total balance of $9,200.</p>\n<p>If you invest $8,000 for three years at 5 per cent, with compound interest calculated and added monthly, you would earn $1,292 in compound interest after three years, giving you a total of $9,292. The total returns are higher because you earn interest on interest.</p>\n<h3>Advantages and disadvantages of high-interest bank accounts</h3>\n<p>There are plenty of investment options out there, and a high-interest bank account is just one of them. Here are some of the potential benefits and drawbacks to having a high-interest transaction account:</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Safe investment &ndash;</strong> Your money is protected under the Australian government&rsquo;s guarantee for authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) such as banks, building societies and credit unions.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy access &ndash;</strong> Because it&rsquo;s a transaction account, it&rsquo;s easy for you to access your money when you need it.</li>\n<li><strong>Dual function &ndash;</strong> You can use a single account for everyday expenses as well as to save money.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lower interest rates &ndash;</strong> Typically, even high-interest bank accounts have a lower interest rate than savings accounts.</li>\n<li><strong>Savings and everyday expenses are combined &ndash;</strong> You may find it easier to stick to a savings plan if you have a separate savings account that you don&rsquo;t dip into for day-to-day expenses.</li>\n<li><strong>Returns are modest &ndash;</strong> Other investment options may yield better returns (although they also tend to be riskier).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What to look for when choosing a high-interest bank account</h3>\n<p>Not all high-interest bank accounts are created equal, so it pays to do some research and find one that can offer you the most value and savings potential over time. Here are three&nbsp;of the key considerations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Introductory rates</strong></p>\n<p>Some bank accounts come with an offer of a high introductory variable interest rate for a set period. Once this period is over, the interest rate will default to the standard. Check how long the introductory rate applies (if there is one) and whether the standard rate is reasonable.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Fees</strong></p>\n<p>Some high-interest bank accounts come with account-keeping fees or transaction fees. If you choose an account with fees, make sure the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Savings goals</strong></p>\n<p>Your savings plan and goals should dictate the type of high-interest bank account you choose. For example, if you are putting money aside for a year to go on a holiday, an account with a high introductory rate but lower standard rate might suit you. On the other hand, if you are saving for a house deposit over a few years, you may want to look for a long-term savings account with a more stable interest rate.</p>\n<p>Take a look at RateCity&rsquo;s <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/bank-accounts/high-interest"">high-interest bank account comparison tool</a></span> to find an account that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>",,1000,4,25,0,11,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,106.85,210.0

Bank accounts with low fees may be an attractive offer for those who wish to open an account but aren&rsquo;t willing to pay monthly maintenance fees.</span></p>\n<h3>What are typical bank account fees?</h3>\n<p><span>While it&rsquo;s possible to find a bank account with low fees, you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find a bank account with no fees at all. There are a few different fees that are typical of most bank accounts.</span></p>\n<p><span>One of these fees is the monthly maintenance fee. Banks may charge you a small sum once a month for the convenience of having a transaction account. However, not all accounts will charge this monthly fee. Many banks offer certain accounts that waive the monthly fee altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another possible bank account fee is an ATM withdrawal fee. Most banks don&rsquo;t charge you if you withdraw from one of the bank&rsquo;s affiliated ATMs, but typically add a fee if you use an ATM by another bank. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to make sure there are affiliated ATMs nearby when you sign up for a bank account.</span></p>\n<p><span>You may also run into fees like cheque deposit and branch withdrawal fees. A cheque deposit fee occurs when you need to deposit funds into your account via cheque. Branch withdrawal fees may apply if you withdraw cash in person at a bank branch rather than from an ATM.</span></p>\n<h3>How do you avoid bank account fees?</h3>\n<p><span>You&rsquo;re unlikely to avoid bank account fees altogether. At a minimum, most transaction accounts will incur a withdrawal fee for using an unaffiliated ATM. </span></p>\n<p><span>So if you&rsquo;re determined to open a bank account without fees, you may have to resign yourself to looking for a low-fees bank account rather than one with no fees at all.</span></p>\n<h3>Who should apply for a low-fee bank account?</h3>\n<p><span>Anyone can apply for a low-fee bank account, but the absence of high fees might be especially helpful for people who want to open a transaction account but are unwilling to pay much money to have one. </span></p>\n<p><span>Bank accounts with low fees are perfect for beginner bankers who are starting to manage and track their finances and would rather not be charged a monthly fee.</span></p>\n<h3>What is a transaction account?</h3>\n<p><span>Low-fee bank accounts are transaction accounts that can be used to house your salary, pay for purchases, pay bills and withdraw cash. Also called &lsquo;everyday accounts&rsquo;, your low-fee bank account will usually come with a debit card that makes your everyday spending quick and easy.</span></p>\n<p><span>Many banks also offer online access to your transaction accounts. Online or on their bank app, you&rsquo;re able to view your account balance and recent transactions, make money transfers and manage your spending. Certain banks even allow you to order cash to an ATM location near you.</span></p>\n<h3>How do you open a low-fee bank account?</h3>\n<p><span>Opening a low-fee bank account is much like opening any other account. First, you&rsquo;ll need to decide which bank account suits your needs and interests. </span></p>\n<p><span>After you&rsquo;ve done your research and made a choice, you can then apply to open the account through the associated bank. These applications can usually be done both online and in person. You&rsquo;ll likely need a form of identification and your personal details to complete your application. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re a student and want to apply for a student bank account, you&rsquo;ll also need proof of study. Typically, your student identification card will suffice, but be sure to check with the bank to see if they require anything further.</span></p>\n<h3>How do you put money into your low-fee bank account?</h3>\n<p><span>Putting money into your bank account is a matter of making deposits. These deposits can be automatic, such as your salary from an employer. Many people decide to have their salary deposited directly into their bank account so that they have the funds to make everyday purchases and pay bills.</span></p>\n<p><span>You can also manually deposit money into your account by transferring from another account or depositing cash at a bank branch. After you&rsquo;ve deposited your funds into your account, you&rsquo;ll be able to see your balance and make purchases accordingly.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re looking for a bank account that won&rsquo;t charge you high fees, then a low-fee bank account may be your solution. Offering all the benefits of other accounts, your low-fee bank account will let you manage your money without the monthly fee.</span></p>",,20,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2.0,473.5

It could also apply to your ongoing balance after your account is opened.</p>\n<p>Banks apply this rule to accounts in order to encourage account holders to keep a certain amount of funds in their account at all times.</p>\n<h3>Are there penalties for dropping below a minimum balance?</h3>\n<p>Penalties and fees vary greatly from bank to bank. Generally, banks require you to have a minimum balance in your account to avoid paying maintenance fees.</p>\n<p>This means that rather than charging you with a penalty, they&rsquo;ll charge you with a maintenance fee when your balance drops below their specified minimum.</p>\n<h3>How do you avoid paying a minimum balance fee?</h3>\n<p>If your bank account requires a minimum balance each month, there are a few steps you can take to prevent the fee from being applied.</p>\n<p>First, it&rsquo;s important to know when your bank applies the minimum balance fee. They may assess at the end of each business day, calculate your average monthly balance, or charge on a certain day of the month. If you know when the fee is charged, it can help you manage your balance to ensure it doesn&rsquo;t meet the minimum balance fee criteria.</p>\n<p>Another way to avoid the minimum balance fee is to set up a direct deposit into your bank account. When you have your monthly salary put directly into your bank account, you&rsquo;ll find that your balance will stay higher, and therefore you may avoid minimum balance fees.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a student or under the age of 25, you may be eligible for certain fees to be waived. Ask your bank about possible options to avoid paying a monthly or minimum balance fee.</p>\n<h3>How do you find a bank account with no minimum balance?</h3>\n<p>Many banks offer bank accounts with no minimum balance required, particularly for students and young people. When searching for accounts without a minimum balance requirement, be sure to ask about both a starting balance minimum and an ongoing balance minimum. This will help you understand how to manage your funds to avoid minimum balance fees.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to bank but don&rsquo;t tend to have a big balance, then finding a bank account with no minimum balance requirements may be a great place to start. Build your balance or just keep a little without having to worry about paying pesky minimum balance fees.</p>",,10,0,0,1,36,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,4.75,419.0

This fee is usually a percentage of the purchase you&rsquo;ve made. This percentage varies from card to card.</p>\n<h3>Are there other kinds of overseas fees?</h3>\n<p>Banks charge a few different types of overseas fees that are important to understand before heading on holiday. One of these fees is a currency conversion fee. This fee applies when making purchases in a currency that is different from your home country&rsquo;s currency. Because your bank has the task of converting your purchase from one currency to another, they may charge this fee. A currency conversion fee can apply whether you&rsquo;re shopping while abroad or shopping on an international website.</p>\n<p>Your credit card may also charge a foreign ATM withdrawal fee. This fee tends to be higher than any ATM fee you would pay inside your home country. A foreign ATM fee applies when you withdraw cash from an ATM abroad.</p>\n<h3>What are the benefits of bank accounts with no foreign transaction fees?</h3>\n<p>Bank accounts with no foreign transaction fees are especially beneficial to avid travellers. The absence of fees means that you can make purchases and withdraw cash freely without paying bank fees on top. This will not only save you money during your time abroad, but it will also make it more convenient to spend on international websites.</p>\n<p>Online shoppers can also benefit greatly from no-foreign-transaction-fee bank accounts. If you often make purchases on foreign websites, you might find yourself paying high surcharges on those purchases. Bank accounts with no foreign transaction fees will save you from paying extra for international products.</p>\n<h3>Where can you find a no-foreign-transaction-fee bank account?</h3>\n<p>If you have an everyday bank account, it&rsquo;s unlikely that the associated card has zero foreign transaction fees.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to make foreign purchases without high fees, you may consider a debit or credit card without overseas fees. You can find several cards that are designed for travellers and make overseas spending easy and affordable.</p>\n<h3>How do you apply for a bank account with no foreign transaction fees?</h3>\n<p>To apply for a bank account with no foreign transaction fees, you&rsquo;ll first need to decide which account suits your needs.</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve chosen your new bank account, you&rsquo;ll complete a bank application, either online or in person, that will include your personal details and a form of identification.</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve completed the application, your bank will review it and open your new account.</p>",,5,0,3,0,33,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,4.25,424.5

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Bank Accounts that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h3>What is a student bank account?</h3>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re studying, life tends to get busy. Student bank accounts can help you easily manage your money, track your spending and pay your bills.</p>\n<p>A student bank account is a transaction account that has been specifically designed for students. These accounts tend to have certain benefits, such as discounts on banking products, and have little to no fees.</p>\n<h3>How is a student bank account different than other bank accounts?</h3>\n<p>Student bank accounts are designed with students in mind. While they can vary from bank to bank, student accounts usually have lower fees than your average bank account. This might mean they slash the monthly fee to make it more affordable for students.</p>\n<p>Banks may also offer benefits or discounts for students. These benefits can differ greatly, but they&rsquo;re typically linked with bank products. You may have access to a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards/no-annual-fee"">$0 annual fee credit card</a> or get a student discount card.</p>\n<p>Typically, student bank accounts function in the same way that normal accounts do. This means that you can still make cash withdrawals, make everyday purchases and deposit funds.</p>\n<h3>Do I need a student bank account?</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a student who wants to open a bank account, it&rsquo;s not required that you open one that&rsquo;s specifically for students. However, if you choose to open a bank account that is not designed for students, you may end up paying fees that student accounts typically waive.</p>\n<p>For students who want to manage their money and spending easily and without fees, a student account may be more beneficial than any other bank account.</p>\n<h3>How do you open a student bank account?</h3>\n<p>Many lenders offer student bank accounts. If you already use a bank, you may choose to open a student account through them, or you may find a great option with a different bank.</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve chosen the student account for you, there will likely be an application process with the bank. This process will collect your details and verify your identity before opening your account. While the application may sometimes be completed online, you may need to visit a bank branch to apply.</p>\n<h3>Do student bank accounts have fees?</h3>\n<p>Most student bank accounts prioritise affordability. As such, you&rsquo;ll find many student accounts that cancel the monthly fee. There may be other fees, however, such as ATM withdrawal fees. Though some fees may not affect you at all, you should consider your daily habits to make sure you&rsquo;re avoiding high fees.</p>\n<h3>What should you look for when choosing a student account?</h3>\n<p>Choosing a student account is much like choosing other banking products. It&rsquo;s all about finding the account that fits with your lifestyle and your priorities.</p>\n<p>You might first consider the fees. Are you happy to pay a monthly fee? If not, you can avoid student accounts that require monthly payments. Do you withdraw cash often from different locations? If so, you might consider looking for a student account with minimal or no ATM fees.</p>\n<p>Some banks will offer benefits when you open their student account. These benefits might include a student discount offer, a fee-free credit card offer or a loan offer. Consider your future financial goals to decide which benefits might be suited to you.</p>\n<p>If you plan on keeping your student account even after you stop studying, it might be beneficial to speak with your chosen bank about how the account will transition from a student bank account to an everyday transaction account. It&rsquo;s possible certain fees will be added, or they may indicate that you need to open a new account. Take this into consideration when making your decision.</p>\n<h3>Do I have to prove that I&rsquo;m a student to open a student bank account?</h3>\n<p>Proof of study requirements vary from bank to bank. Typically, your bank will require at least one document to prove that you&rsquo;re a student before your account application can be approved. Your student identification card is usually enough to open an account, but check with your bank to ensure that they don&rsquo;t require any other proof of study.</p>\n<h3>Can non-students open a student bank account?</h3>\n<p>The answer to this question depends predominantly on your age. Many banks restrict their student bank accounts to students alone, while others will allow anyone under the age of 25 to apply. You&rsquo;ll need to check with your bank about their age and status criteria.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a student and want to take control of your finances, a student bank account can be a good place to start. Your student account will allow you to manage your spending and make everyday purchases as you enjoy lower fees and extra benefits.</p>",,210,0,0,0,391,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,60.1,255.0

Adelaide is known for its commercial and financial sectors, with Adelaidean businesses and residents benefiting from highly competitive deals, and the city itself has been consistently rated as one of the best places to live in Australia.</p>\n<h3>How do  in Adelaide work?</h3>\n<p>As with most types of personal finance, your credit history is thoroughly checked when you apply for a car loan in Adelaide. If this presents a difficulty due to past blemishes on your record, you should look for a lender that offers decent rates to people who have poor credit ratings. There are certainly companies that specialise in offering very competitive rates on finance for people in nonconforming circumstances, including pensioners, single parents and those searching for low doc solutions so they can replace their Ute or other vehicle as quickly as possible. No matter what your status or financial track record, there are bound to be <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans"">Adelaide </a></span> to suit you.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features of  in Adelaide?</h3>\n<p>When borrowing money to finance the purchase of a new or second-hand vehicle, you will want to look for the best possible deals in terms of fees and charges, as well as interest rates. It's always a good idea to use the comparison rate displayed alongside the advertised rate. This allows you to get a clear idea of the true cost of borrowing from a specific lender, as it incorporates all additional fees and charges that apply to each loan offer.</p>\n<p>If you have any special requirements, you should also check whether these would cost extra. For example, some loans include the option of making flexible repayments so that when you have extra funds available, you can pay more than the minimum amount required. In this way, you have the chance to pay off your loan more quickly, thereby saving interest costs. Always check whether this arrangement is free of any additional fees. Interest rates for  in Adelaide are either fixed or variable, and may be secured or unsecured, so take this into account when you're making a final decision.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons?</h3>\n<p>A decent car loan can help you buy a vehicle promptly, and in most cases it's possible to complete an application online. The terms of your car loan should be reasonable, so that you are repaying the sum you have borrowed in a way that&rsquo;s convenient and affordable.</p>\n<p>Consider the comparison rate before you get excited about a &lsquo;surprisingly low&rsquo; advertised rate and always check that there is no penalty if you are in the fortunate position of being able to pay off your loan early or if you are seeking flexible repayments.&nbsp;</p>",,210,28,104,114,11192,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1186.9,96.0

And that's not forgetting the vast amount of coast where you can drive on a long holiday or just a weekend break. Owning a car is essential for the vast majority of Australians, whether it's to get to work, take the kids to school, do the shopping, visit friends or take to the wide open roads on a voyage of exploration. If you want to buy your first car or upgrade to a brand new one, <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/ratings"">Australia </a></span> could turn your dreams into reality.</p>\n<h3>How do  in Australia work?</h3>\n<p>In a competitive market, you'll discover that interest rates are kept low and there is a wide range of financial institutions offering personal loans to buy cars. You can make applications online, by phone, or go to a bank or other lender's branch or office to talk through your options.</p>\n<p>Your choice of  will depend on your personal circumstances, and you may also have preferences when it comes to deciding what suits you best. A secured loan, for example, where your car, your property or another valuable asset is used as a guarantee for the loan, will usually have a lower interest rate than that of an unsecured loan. Your credit history will be checked and you can usually negotiate with your lender to get the terms best suited to you.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features of  in Australia?</h3>\n<p>You can be offered a number of different types of car loan, with interest rates that could be variable or fixed. Features may include the option to make flexible repayments to suit your cash flow, or introductory offers with very low interest rates for a fixed period.</p>\n<p>A balloon payment arrangement offers you smaller regular payments with a large one at the end of the loan term, but you could refinance if you don't have the money to pay that back at once, settle the debt, and repay the new one in instalments.</p>\n<p>Flexible payments permit you to make more than your minimum repayment, but you may be restricted by your lender as to how many times you can do this. Watch out for additional fees that lenders may charge for this option, and always examine penalty clauses and up front fees, as well as interest rates, before you make a decision.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons?</h3>\n<p>Lenders will advertise an interest rate, but you should always use a loan comparison tool to factor in all the fees and charges, not just the interest rate. It's easy to be baffled by the jargon, so rather than guessing, take the time to get an accurate idea of how much each loan really costs.</p>\n<p>To get the best deal available, always use the comparison rate instead of the lender&rsquo;s advertised rate. The comparison rate factors in any additional charges and fees that are applicable to each loan offer, thereby giving you a more accurate illustration of the true cost of each loan. Use a loan calculator to help you to work out the monthly payments you will need to make.</p>\n<p>Read your car loan agreement carefully before making a commitment to avoid running the risk of defaulting on your payments, which could ultimately damage your credit history.</p>",,1900,2044,8163,8413,196296,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,23328.0,21.0

Many lenders may deem you ineligible for a loan, or charge very high interest rates because they consider you a huge risk. However, certain lenders specialise in providing bad credit  and can help you fulfil your car-owning dream.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the concept of credit ratings and bad credit ratings, including how are they determined and how to improve them, and how they relate to bad credit :</p>\n<h3>Credit Ratings</h3>\n<h4>WHAT IS A CREDIT RATING?</h4>\n<p>A credit rating (or credit score) is the assessment of the credit risks associated with a prospective borrower. It is a numeric score assigned to an individual, business, or government that predicts the borrower&rsquo;s ability to pay back the loan, along with the chances of the borrower defaulting.</p>\n<h4>HOW IS A CREDIT RATING DETERMINED?</h4>\n<p>A credit rating is calculated based on the borrower&rsquo;s credit history, including factors such as payment history, the amount owed, types of credit, bankruptcy, payment defaults, etc. Though the precise algorithms followed by different lenders and rating organisations are not known, it is safe to say that a borrower&rsquo;s credit rating depends on their past borrowing and repayment habits.</p>\n<h4>WHO DETERMINES YOUR CREDIT RATING?</h4>\n<p>Credit ratings are determined by credit rating agencies like Equifax (previously Veda Advantage), Experian, and Dun & Bradstreet. These ratings are used by lenders to determine the risk of defaulting should they lend to you.<strong>How to find your credit rating?</strong></p>\n<p>You can contact a credit rating organisation like<a href=""http://mycreditfile.com.au/""> Equifax</a>, <span><a href=""http://dnb.com.au/"">Dun & Bradstreet</a></span>, or <span><a href=""http://www.experian.com.au/credit-services/credit-reports/order-credit-report.html"">Experian </a></span>to get access to your credit file. Your credit file contains basic information such as your name, age, gender, and contact details, along with your driver&rsquo;s license number, employment details, and most importantly, your credit history.</p>\n<h3>Bad Credit Ratings</h3>\n<h4>WHAT IS A BAD CREDIT RATING?</h4>\n<p>A bad credit rating means that you are a high-risk borrower with &nbsp;greater chance of defaulting. Each credit agency uses its own algorithm to calculate a credit rating and its own scale to differentiate a good credit rating from a bad one.</p>\n<h4>WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE FACTORS BEHIND A BAD CREDIT RATING?</h4>\n<p>Factors that can harm your credit rating include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missed or delayed repayments</li>\n<li>Defaulting on a loan</li>\n<li>Previous credit applications</li>\n<li>Exceeding card limits</li>\n<li>Past bankruptcy or credit infringements</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>WHAT IS COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT REPORTING?</h4>\n<p>In the past, credit files did not provide a very holistic view of a borrower&rsquo;s overall credit performance. Even a small negative event, like a late bill payment, left a negative impact on an otherwise good credit performance.</p>\n<p>Starting March 2014, the Australian credit system began reporting credit more comprehensively. This change included a more holistic and thorough view of the past payments, with positive events cancelling out the negative ones to get a more accurate credit report.</p>\n<h4>HOW TO IMPROVE A BAD CREDIT RATING?</h4>\n<p>Improving your credit rating requires some effort. Here are a few things you can do to help fix a bad credit rating:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Due to comprehensive credit reporting, the positive events in your credit file can help balance out the negatives. For example, if you&rsquo;re late with a loan repayment, catching up and consistently paying the loan on time in the future can help to cancel out part of your negative score.</li>\n<li>Paying off a new or existing loan &ndash; as per the loan schedule &ndash; can help improve your credit score.</li>\n<li>Check your credit history for accuracy. If you find any errors in the file, bring them to the attention of the appropriate authority to be corrected.</li>\n<li>A debt consolidation loan can come in handy if you have multiple outstanding debts, as a single account and interest rate is easier to manage. There are lenders that specialise in this type of loan for individuals with bad credit.</li>\n<li>Opting for direct debit of your repayments is a great idea. It helps make sure you don&rsquo;t miss any repayments due to negligence, and thus helps to protect your credit score.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bad Credit Car Loan</h3>\n<h4>WHAT IS A BAD CREDIT CAR LOAN?</h4>\n<p>Bad credit  allow people with impaired credit files and bad credit histories to purchase their dream cars. These loans can also help other types of borrowers, like 457 visa holders and the self-employed, who are considered high risks by some lenders.</p>\n<h4>WHY SHOULD YOU OPT FOR A BAD CREDIT CAR LOAN?</h4>\n<p>A bad credit rating means that if you go to regular lenders, they will either not approve your loan request, or they will offer a loan at a very high interest rate. A lender who specialises in Bad Credit  can offer loans at lower interest, and with faster approval. They can also provide credit management suggestions to help you improve your credit rating. Additionally, opting for a Bad Credit Car Loan and paying it back as per the repayment schedule can help improve your credit rating and make you the owner of the car of your dreams.</p>\n<h4>WHAT FACTORS SHOULD YOU CONSIDER BEFORE APPLYING FOR A BAD CREDIT CAR LOAN?</h4>\n<p>You need to consider certain situations and weigh your options before opting for a Bad Credit Car Loan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a<a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/calculator""> loan calculator</a> to find your loan repayment amount, compare it to your income, and consider whether you can afford to make this payment each month. If not, consider offering an asset as security or getting a guarantor to lower the rate of interest.</li>\n<li>If your car loan&rsquo;s monthly repayments are still too high, you may be able to opt for a longer loan term to reduce this amount. You&rsquo;ll end up paying more in total interest with a longer loan term than a shorter one, but the monthly repayments will be more affordable. A shorter loan term, on the other hand, would mean less interest paid overall, but higher monthly repayments.</li>\n<li>You can choose a<a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/fixed-rate""> fixed interest rate</a> or a<a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/variable-rate""> variable interest rate</a> for your car loan. A fixed rate will remain the same for the duration of the loan, for more consistent repayments and simpler budgeting. Opting for a variable rate car loan can be beneficial if there is a decrease in interest rates, but it can also be disadvantageous if your lender increases its rates. You can compare specific features of the two types of loans on our<a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/compare""> car loan comparison page</a>.</li>\n<li>Check for any additional costs for your car loan, such as fees (establishment and ongoing fees, early exit fees etc.) and other charges (registration, insurance, extended warranty etc.). You may have the option to extend your car loan to cover these extra costs as well as the value of the vehicle, though this would mean paying more in interest to cover this extra debt.</li>\n<li>If possible, avoid borrowing 100% of the car price with your car loan, as the value of a car depreciates over time. If you&rsquo;re unable to make your car loan repayments, the lender may need to sell the car to cover the cost, with you making up any remaining difference in value. The higher a deposit you can afford at the start of your car loan, the lower the principal you&rsquo;ll be required to repay, and the more you&rsquo;ll save on interest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>HOW TO GET APPROVAL ON YOUR BAD CREDIT CAR LOAN?</h4>\n<p>Getting a car loan with a poor credit rating can be difficult, but a Bad Credit Car Loan can help make your dream of owning a car a reality. Though these loans are intended for people with bad credit ratings, so getting approval should not be a problem in many cases, there are a few things you can do to help streamline the approval process for your Bad Credit Car Loan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improve your financial situation:</strong> Take steps to improve your financial situation and your credit rating. Comprehensive credit reporting allows you to balance out your past financial problems against the positives in your file. Pay your bills on time, save money, and manage your finances smartly to get back on track. This also makes your case stronger in front of your lender.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid multiple loan applications:</strong> Compare various car loan lenders, including Bad Credit Car Loan lenders, but do not apply everywhere. You can put your financial situation forward honestly and ask your lender for advice. Apply only once you&rsquo;re confident of getting an approval for the best deal to suit your situation. Loan application rejections reflect negatively on your credit file, so it&rsquo;s not wise to apply everywhere.</li>\n<li><strong>Be honest about your financial situation:</strong> Describe your financial situation honestly to your Bad Credit Car Loan lender.

After all, the loan that&rsquo;s &ldquo;the best&rdquo; for your unique financial situation may not be ideal for other borrowers looking to buy some wheels, due to the great variety of lenders and loan offers available on the Australian car loan marketplace.</span></p>\n<p><span>At RateCity, you see for yourself which  offer low interest rates, low fees, or flexible repayment terms, and use this information to determine which car loan will be the best for you. Read through our guide, compare the car loan offers available from the different lenders, and make a smarter, more informed decision when you choose your car loan. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How much do you need to borrow? </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;ve already done your research and know what car you want, then you should only need to borrow the value of that car &ndash; easy! You could possibly add a little more to your car loan to cover extra costs such as insurance, but generally speaking the less you choose to borrow, the smaller your monthly repayments, and the more money you ultimately save in interest and fees.</span></p>\n<p><span>The other option is to calculate the maximum car loan total you can afford to repay, then go car shopping with this budget in mind. Just take care, and resist the temptation to blow your entire preapproved budget on a super-luxury vehicle if you ultimately don&rsquo;t REALLY need it. Choose your car with your head, not your heart, and you could ultimately get a more affordable deal. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How much can you afford to pay back per month? </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>When comparing , try to get an approximate idea of how much you can afford to pay back each month, and use this figure to help you determine which  may be the best for you. </span></p>\n<p><span>Remember that if you opt for a car loan with a variable interest rate, your repayments could go up or down from month to month, so if you&rsquo;re planning your budget in advance, it&rsquo;s worth leaving a bit of wiggle room just in case of surprise interest rate rises. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;d rather not risk having rate rises leave you out of pocket, you might consider a fixed rate car loan, where the interest rate is set in advance and stays the same for the lifetime of the loan. While you won&rsquo;t enjoy savings from interest rate cuts, at least you&rsquo;ll enjoy the confidence and security of knowing exactly how much money you&rsquo;ll be paying per month, with no surprises. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you want to keep your monthly repayments on the lower side, it&rsquo;s possible to stretch out the length of your car loan, and pay back the balance in smaller instalments over a longer period of time. Just keep in mind that if you choose a longer car loan term, you&rsquo;ll ultimately pay more in interest over the lifetime of the loan, likely costing you more in total than if you&rsquo;d made larger monthly repayments over a shorter period.</span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s also worth remembering that for many , you won&rsquo;t just be paying interest, but additional fees and charges as well, such as application fees and ongoing fees. To get a better idea of which  are likely to cost you more in total, check out their Comparison Rates, which combine their advertised interest rates with their standard fees and charges, and express them as a percentage. Remember that a car loan&rsquo;s comparison rate doesn&rsquo;t include its every cost, nor does it account for its extra features, so use the comparison rate a guideline and not as a decision-maker. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Can you use the car as security?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Many  are Secured Loans, where if for any reason you&rsquo;re unable to make your repayments, the lender will recover its losses by repossessing an asset of yours &ndash; usually the car you&rsquo;re buying. These loans often have lower interest rates, as they represent less risk to the lender, though some lenders only offer secured loans for cars that fit certain criteria, such as cars under a certain age, or particular vehicle models.</span></p>\n<p><span>If the vehicle you&rsquo;re looking at isn&rsquo;t eligible for a secured loan, some lenders offer Unsecured , where your shiny new (or used) vehicle is not at risk of being repossessed, but you may have to pay a higher interest rate instead. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Are you buying a new or used car?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>While you may need to pay more up front for a brand new car, lenders tend to consider new cars to be less of a financial risk than used cars (less wear and tear, plus newer technology means they&rsquo;re more likely to last for longer), so you may enjoy a more competitive interest rate on a new car loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>Because used cars are perceived as greater financial risks by lenders, you&rsquo;ll likely pay more in interest for a used car loan. That said, used cars are often somewhat less expensive to buy than new cars, balancing the scales somewhat. Plus, the value of a used car tends to depreciate more slowly than a new car, so you should ultimately enjoy more value from your loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>What counts as a &ldquo;new&rdquo; or &ldquo;used&rdquo; car for the purposes of ? Different lenders use different criteria &ndash; some may classify any car less than 2 years old as &ldquo;new&rdquo; and any older car as &ldquo;used&rdquo; and set their terms accordingly. Some lenders also have a maximum age for vehicles they&rsquo;ll offer loans for (e.g. 5 years), as vehicles older than this are considered too high-risk.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Want to be able to pay off your car loan early?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you find yourself with some extra money available, such as if you receive a bonus from work, a tax refund, or if an interest rate cut leaves you with a budget surplus this month, you might be able to add that extra cash onto your car loan. By making higher or additional repayments, you can get closer to exiting your car loan early, and reduce the total amount of interest you need to pay. </span></p>\n<p><span>Just be mindful that some lenders charge fees for making additional payments and/or making an early exit from your loan, to make up for some of the lost interest. These fees and charges tend to be more common for fixed-rate  where your repayments are scheduled well in advance, but always check first before taking out a car loan.</span></p>\n<p><span>A Redraw Facility is another handy feature to keep an eye out for if you&rsquo;re thinking of adding extra money onto your car loan. If you find yourself in a tight financial spot, a redraw facility will allow you to put any extra money you&rsquo;ve paid onto your car loan back into your pocket, freeing up your finances to cover unexpected expenses. This extra flexibility can allow you to pay extra onto your car loan with confidence, as you&rsquo;ll be able to access these funds again if you really need them. Just check your lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions, in case there are restrictions on how the redraw facility can be used.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Do you have a deposit ready?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you have your eye on a particular car, but don&rsquo;t have enough money saved up to make a full deposit on a car loan, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that vehicle&rsquo;s out of your reach. Some lenders offer  with a high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), where you pay a smaller deposit and borrow a greater percentage of the car&rsquo;s value. Some lenders also offer 100% , where you pay no deposit and instead borrow the full value of the car. These loans typically involve higher interest rates due to the increased risk to the lender, so check whether you can afford the repayments to determine if a 100% car loan is the best choice for you.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare rates and find the best  for you</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Remember, the best car loan for you is the one where you get the funds and the features you want, as well as repayments you can comfortably afford, and you get to drive away in your newly-purchased ride. </span></p>\n<p><span>By comparing the car loan offers at RateCity, you should soon be able to narrow down your options to just the  offering the terms that best suit your needs.</span></p>\n<p><em>*The phrase 'some of the best' is not a product endorsement or recommendation.

Whatever your decision you will probably be constrained by your budget and the chances are you will need to borrow money to purchase exactly what you want. <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/ratings"">Boat loans</a></span> are available to help you bridge the gap between the amount of money you have and the amount you need to buy the boat.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How do boat loans work?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A boat loan is a personal loan and has the same attributes as a car loan or, at the upper end of the financial spectrum, a mortgage to buy a home. When you take out a boat loan you will be assessed by lenders on the level of your income and your outgoings, so a financial institution that is considering lending to you can be as certain as possible that you have the means to pay back the loan. When you are offered a loan you should check out the interest rate being charged against the length of time you want the loan for, and plan your monthly repayments so you're sure you can afford them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Why do people use boat loans?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most people don't have the spare cash to purchase a boat outright, so they turn to boat loans to help buy what they want. It's an effective way of being able to purchase a large item that would otherwise be unaffordable. Boat loans also give you control over your repayments as you have the opportunity to find lenders who are eager for your business and may offer very good deals in terms of interest rates. You should always look out for hidden charges before you accept a boat loan agreement, especially if a deal looks too good to be true.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What are the main features?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As with any personal loan you will have options in terms of choosing an interest rate, the time period to pay off the loan, and whether you have a fixed or variable interest rate. Fixed rates are generally the norm for personal loans but if you are intending to borrow a large amount you should look for the possibility of having a variable rate and discuss it with potential lenders. You might find an introductory deal for new borrowers that will offer a lower interest rate for a fixed time period before reverting to a higher rate, and this could save you money in the long term.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What are the pros and cons of boat loans?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should always be clear about what you can afford to repay, so using a loan calculator will give you the information you need so you can plan your repayments effectively. A boat loan will give you the freedom to buy what you want but if you fail to keep up repayments on a regular basis you are likely to lose the boat and all the money you have previously repaid.</p>",,1000,1,46,34,3454,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,457.90000000000003,145.0

If you're a Brisbanite or live in some of the other lovely locations in Queensland, you probably enjoy regular car trips to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, as do many international visitors. After all those clicks, when the time comes to replace your car with a second-hand model or a new one, there are plenty of car loan deals to choose from.</p>\n<h3>How do  in Brisbane work?</h3>\n<p>Lenders will first check your credit history when you apply for a car loan, with some lenders being willing to accept borrowers with some blemishes on their record. Sometimes interest rates for these loans will be higher than others. Also, there are some lenders that specialise in offering very decent rates on finance for people in nonconforming circumstances, including single parents, those who are searching for low doc solutions, and pensioners. As competition is strong, in most cases, no matter your status or financial track record, there are likely to be  to suit you.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features of  in Brisbane?</h3>\n<p>When borrowing funds to finance your vehicle, you can look for the best possible deal, taking into account fees and charges as well as interest rates.

For instance, some lenders offer the opportunity to make bigger repayments from time to time, so that should you have extra money available you can pay a bit more than the minimum amount required. This system offers you the chance to repay your loan early, saving some interest. However, it's worth making sure there are no additional fees to pay, as otherwise these features may not be of benefit to you. When deciding on your preferred lender, check whether you want variable or fixed Interest rates and a secured or unsecured car loan.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros</strong> and<strong> cons?</strong></h3>\n<p>Getting a car loan can help you buy the vehicle of your choice. Most lenders will let you know about your application quickly and in many cases you can complete an online application. Make sure the terms of your car loan are reasonable, and that you are repaying the sum you have borrowed without suffering any financial hardship.</p>\n<p>If you come across an extremely low advertised rate, you should always check the comparison rate alongside it, as this takes into account any extra fees and charges.</p>",,260,1,11,6,2309,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,259.95000000000005,169.0

RateCity&rsquo;s car loan calculator lets you play around with the borrowing amount, interest rate, loan term and repayment frequency.</p>\n<p>There are three things you&rsquo;ll need to know to use RateCity&rsquo;s car loan calculator:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How much you plan to borrow</strong> &ndash; This is typically the value of the car you plan to buy, though some  can also include other expenses, such as insurance costs, fees and extended warranties, as part of the loan. Keep in mind that the more money you borrow, the longer it may take to pay back your car loan, and the more interest you'll likely be charged.</li>\n<li><strong>The length of your car loan term</strong> &ndash; The shorter the term of your car loan, the sooner your car will be fully paid off and the less interest you&rsquo;ll pay in total, even if your monthly repayments are higher. Lengthening your car loan term means making more repayments, each one for a smaller amount. This can help make your loan more affordable in the short term, though you&rsquo;ll end up paying more interest in total by the end of the extended term.</li>\n<li><strong>The interest rate you&rsquo;d like to pay</strong> &ndash; While many of us would love a basic car loan with a low interest rate, these loans may also have more specific lending criteria, and thus may not be available to all borrowers. Some  with higher interest rates may offer more features and greater flexibility, which may provide greater value for money to the right borrower.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The best way to use a car loan calculator is to play around with different scenarios. So type in a range of borrowing amounts, loan terms, interest rates and repayment schedules.&nbsp;You might be surprised to discover how seemingly minor changes to the car loan calculator can result in significant changes to your repayment instalments.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>What is a car loan?</h3>\n<p>A car loan is a loan that is specifically used to buy a vehicle, such as a car, van, motorbike or truck.</p>\n<p>There are two different types of interest &ndash; variable-rate interest and fixed-rate interest.</p>\n<p>With a variable-rate car loan, the lender is entitled to change the interest rate at any time during the life of your loan. For example, your loan might start at 7.50 per cent; six months later, it might increase to 7.60 per cent; three months after that, it might fall to 7.45 per cent.</p>\n<p>With a fixed-rate car loan, the lender cannot change the interest rate during the fixed-rate period. For example, if you take out a five-year loan that is fixed at 7.50 per cent, you can be certain that the interest rate will remain steady during those five years. However, once the fixed-rate period ends, your loan might automatically be reclassified as a variable-rate loan. In that case, you would be charged whatever the variable rate happened to be, whether it was lower or higher.</p>\n<p>The great thing about a car loan calculator is that it allows you to test different repayment scenarios, so you can see how your finances would be affected by a change in interest rates.</p>\n<h3>What is a secured car loan?</h3>\n<p>With a secured car loan, you use your vehicle as collateral to guarantee the loan. If you default on your repayments, your car could be repossessed to cover the lender&rsquo;s losses. In that case, your car might sell for less than the outstanding debt &ndash; so to cover themselves, some lenders will provide secured  only for new cars or particular used car models under a certain age. That way, the resale price is likely to exceed any outstanding debt. You can use a car loan calculator to work out what your repayments might look like if you took out a secured car loan.</p>\n<h3>What is an unsecured car loan?</h3>\n<p>With an unsecured car loan, you don&rsquo;t have to provide any collateral to the lender. However, unsecured  generally have higher interest rates than secured , because lenders regard them as riskier. To ensure you don't take out a car loan you can't afford, punch some numbers into a car loan calculator and see if you can meet the repayments.</p>\n<p><br /> <img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-55347"" alt=""istock_79305201_small5"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20170804150359/Car-loan1-e1501823068853.jpg"" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>How do I get a car loan?</h3>\n<p>There are three different ways you can get a car loan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let the dealer arrange your finance</li>\n<li>Approach a lender directly</li>\n<li>Go through a finance broker</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Letting your car dealer organise your loan for you is the most convenient option &ndash; but it&rsquo;s also likely to be the least beneficial. That&rsquo;s because dealer finance is often less flexible and more expensive. You might also feel pressured to make big decisions on the spot.</p>\n<p>Approaching a lender directly will allow you to cut out the middleman (i.e. the car dealer). The key, though, is to choose the right lender, because the lender will only discuss its own products. Comparison websites like RateCity make it easier for you to narrow down your options.</p>\n<p>The third option is to go through a finance broker, who will recommend a product to you from someone on his panel of lenders. Brokers offer several positives &ndash; they generally don&rsquo;t charge for their services, they offer expert advice and they give you access to a range of options. The negative, though, is that brokers will only discuss lenders on their panel &ndash; and brokers are highly unlikely to have every lender on their panel.</p>\n<p>Whatever option you choose, you should first use a car loan calculator so you're better informed before you start discussing options.</p>\n<h3>What documents do I need to get a car loan?</h3>\n<p>Different lenders have different requirements, but here are the documents you&rsquo;ll probably be asked to provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proof of identity (100 points of identification)</li>\n<li>Proof of income (utility bill, council notice)</li>\n<li>Proof of savings (payslips, bank statements, tax return)</li>\n<li>Proof of liabilities (bank statements, investment documents)</li>\n<li>Proof of insurance (insurance documents)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How much can I borrow with a car loan?</h3>\n<p>Lenders don&rsquo;t hand out money unless they&rsquo;re confident the loan will be repaid. So one way to think of borrowing capacity is to imagine that it starts at $1 for each person and continues rising until the lender believes it has reached that particular person&rsquo;s limit. For one person, that might be $10,000; for another, that might be $50,000.</p>\n<p>These things are good for borrowing capacity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher incomes</li>\n<li>Bigger asset bases</li>\n<li>Lower spending habits</li>\n<li>Strong credit history</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These things are bad for borrowing capacity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower incomes</li>\n<li>Smaller asset bases</li>\n<li>Higher spending habits</li>\n<li>Weaker credit history</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To work out your income and spending, check your pay slips, bank statements and credit card statements. If your spending exceeds your income, you won&rsquo;t qualify for a car loan. If your income exceeds your spending, you might qualify for a car loan.</p>\n<p>The &lsquo;gap&rsquo; between your income and spending is what you would use to repay the car loan. Once you know what that number is, you can use a car loan calculator to get a rough idea of how much you might be able to borrow.</p>\n<p><br /> <img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-55347"" alt=""istock_79305201_small5"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20170621172657/Car-buying-e1498030041350.jpg"" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Will I be penalised if I repay my car loan early?</h3>\n<p>Some lenders will slug you with early repayment charges if you pay off your car loan ahead of schedule. However, some lenders won&rsquo;t. So this is something you should check before signing up for a car loan. Don't forget to use a car loan calculator before applying for a loan, because this will help you understand your repayment capacity.</p>\n<h3>What is a balloon payment?</h3>\n<p>A balloon payment is a one-off lump sum you pay at the end of a loan. Some lenders will give you the option of making lower repayments on your car loan in return for making a balloon payment. Generally, consumers who take out  with balloon payments end up paying more interest over the life of their loan than consumers who choose a loan with higher repayments but no balloon payment.</p>\n<h3>Should I get a car loan through a dealer?</h3>\n<p>The big advantage of dealer finance is convenience. Instead of having to visit a car dealer and a lender or broker, consumers who opt for dealer finance only have to deal with one party.</p>\n<p>Convenience, though, comes at a cost. Consumers who take out dealer finance often get less flexible  and end up paying more over the life of the loan, compared with consumers who work directly with a lender or take out a loan through a finance broker.</p>\n<p>Another disadvantage of dealer finance is that often applies to a more limited range of makes and models than are available to consumers who take out  via a lender or broker.</p>\n<p>Make sure you punch some numbers into a car loan calculator before you sign up for dealer finance. That way, you won't lock yourself into a loan that you can't afford.</p>\n<h3>What kind of car should I buy?</h3>\n<p>Before you take out a loan to finance your car purchase, you need to figure out what vehicle you want to purchase. And before you choose one of the thousands of makes and models on offer, you should consider whether you want a new or used car.</p>\n<p>There are four main reasons why some buyers prefer new cars to used cars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They come with a warranty</li>\n<li>They have the latest technology</li>\n<li>They&rsquo;re more fuel-efficient</li>\n<li>They&rsquo;re less likely to suffer mechanical problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But used cars also have four advantages over new cars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They&rsquo;re cheaper</li>\n<li>They depreciate more slowly</li>\n<li>You have more room for negotiation</li>\n<li>You have a greater range of models to choose from</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever type of car you decide to buy, make sure you use a car loan calculator to explore different repayment scenarios.</p>\n<p><br /> <img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-55347"" alt=""istock_79305201_small5"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20170620103841/Car-dealership-e1497919143506.jpg"" /><br /><br /></p>\n<h3>What should I consider when comparing ?</h3>\n<p>Consider the benefits of any extra features attached to your car loan, as you might have to pay extra for features you don&rsquo;t need. These extras could include insurance options, extended warranties or shortfall cover.</p>\n<p>Watch out for fees. Numerous lenders charge establishment fees to cover the creation of your loan documentation. Ongoing fees may also be charged from month to month, in addition to the interest, which can make your loan significantly more expensive in the long run.</p>\n<p>To get a better idea of the true cost of different , look at each loan&rsquo;s comparison rate, which combines the advertised interest rate with the lender&rsquo;s standard fees and charges. Remember, though, that some loans include non-standard fees and charges that aren&rsquo;t included in the comparison rate.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to be able to pay off your car loan ahead of schedule and reduce the total interest you pay, check whether your lender charges fees for making extra repayments or for exiting the loan early, as these can make this option less affordable.</p>\n<p>A car loan with a redraw facility can be helpful if you&rsquo;re trying to pay your car loan off ahead of time but are concerned about committing too much of your money to the loan. Once you&rsquo;re ahead of your repayment schedule, a redraw facility can be used to withdraw money from your car loan&rsquo;s surplus balance, which can be a handy option to have available in case of emergencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re buying a car, it&rsquo;s important to organise a report from the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR). Formerly known as a REVS check, this report will determine whether the vehicle is being sold with a financial encumbrance (money owed by a previous owner). You can organise one of these reports for yourself. Some lenders will offer to do this check on your behalf, although they might charge a fee for the service.</p>\n<p>Finally, don't forget to use a car loan calculator, so you can understand how different repayment scenarios would affect your financial position.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>",,22200,1634,11272,19484,657544,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,73404.8,4.0

Leasing is different to taking out a personal loan, where you borrow a lump sum and pay it back with interest and any other fees or charges stipulated. Effectively, a lease is just like renting a car, but lasts for longer than the usual holiday type rental, usually between two and five years. Unlike most personal loans &ndash; though there are exceptions &ndash; there will be a residual payment at the end of the lease period. If there is a lump sum to pay, you can pay it off, or refinance to get some more time to repay.</p>\n<h3>How does a car lease work?</h3>\n<p>There are two ways of getting a <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/best"">car lease</a></span>: a novated lease or a standard car lease. They work in similar ways in that you will be renting a car rather than owning it like when you take out a personal loan &ndash; although if you fail to make loan repayments the car is likely to be repossessed. With a lease, you make regular payments over an agreed period of time based on the purchase price of the car, with interest added along with any fees or charges. When the agreed time period is up, you can choose to trade the car in, pay the residual amount remaining and own it outright, or refinance for another loan or lease.</p>\n<h3>Why do people use a car lease?</h3>\n<p>A car lease can be a cheaper way to finance a new car, both for individuals and for businesses. You know what the repayments will be each month, as these will have been agreed with the lender. Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to own the car outright at the end of the lease period, or enter into another arrangement with the finance company.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features?</h3>\n<p>A novated lease can help you to effectively reduce your taxable income with the Australian tax authorities. In tandem with your employer and a supplier, you choose your car and organise a lease. With this type of lease, your employer takes on the responsibility for making your lease payments by deducting them from your salary prior to you being paid, thus reducing your taxable income.</p>\n<p>An ordinary car lease works in a similar way to a novated lease, except the agreement is between you and the lender and there is not a tax-deductible advantage in the same way.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of car lease?</h3>\n<p>Repayments for a leased car may be cheaper than if you took out a personal loan, and so are useful if you have difficulty making large monthly repayments. You need to plan for what happens at the end of the lease in terms of paying a residual amount to own the car, taking out another lease, or refinancing to get more time to pay.</p>",,20,17,339,254,9142,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1013.6500000000001,101.0

With everything you need in&nbsp;your home away from home, you can set your own pace when travelling, staying for longer in places you like, or moving on&nbsp;if you're not too keen on an area. A caravan doesn't need to be expensive but, as with anything, much larger ones with higher specs can&nbsp;give you more space and comfort. Caravan loans can help you buy your first caravan or upgrade to a classier model.</p>\n<h4><strong>How do caravan loans work?</strong></h4>\n<p>A caravan loan is a personal loan that can be unsecured or secured. Unsecured loans are generally for smaller amounts, and to be eligible for one you'll go through a credit history check so a lender can be as sure as possible you will be able to pay the money back. For larger amounts&nbsp;(caravans at the top end of the market can cost tens of thousands of dollars), you're more likely to be offered a loan that is secured on the vehicle you are buying. That means if you fail to honour the loan agreement and repay everything, you are likely to lose the caravan and all the money you have repaid previously. Caravan loans work in the same way as other types of personal loans, in that you pay back the money you have borrowed plus interest on top of the principal sum.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why do people use caravan loans?</strong></h4>\n<p>Caravans can be expensive when you go upmarket, but you can also find plenty of caravans at the lower end of the market, especially if you are just starting out caravanning and want to see what it's like. Nevertheless, a caravan, even a second-hand one, could still be out of reach of your budget, which is why people take out caravan loans. They are a way of stretching out repayments that are affordable, but give you the immediate availability of the vehicle.</p>\n<h4><strong>What are the main features?</strong></h4>\n<p>Although you could consider your caravan a travelling home, you're unlikely to be offered a home loan to buy one, as this longer term form of borrowing is intended to buy houses. Though if you wanted to buy a static caravan that could be quite expensive, you might find a lender willing to discuss this with you. For a caravan loan, you should compare the types of personal loan available, especially in terms of the interest rates. Secured loans will usually have lower interest rates than unsecured ones, so do your research before making an application.</p>\n<h4><strong>What are the pros and cons of caravan loans?</strong></h4>\n<p>If you don't have all the money you need to buy a caravan, then getting a loan is the best way to get what you want, when you want it. The larger the deposit you can put down, the less you will pay back in interest charges. If you default on the loan, it's likely that the lender will repossess your caravan.</p>",,5,16,213,178,12075,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1274.65,89.0

One that you might find suitable is <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/best"">chattel mortgage business finance</a></span>; a commercial financial product where you take ownership of the vehicle &ndash; known as the chattel &ndash; or vehicles at the time you buy. It's a straightforward loan transaction, and for businesses it may be particularly attractive as there could be tax advantages.</p>\n<h3>How does chattel mortgage business finance work?</h3>\n<p>When you buy a new vehicle for your business, and take ownership of your purchase, your lender will take out a mortgage over the chattel to secure the loan by registering an interest over the vehicle with the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR). This means that if you fail to pay off the amount loaned in the time agreed, and are not making your regular monthly payments, the lender can repossess the vehicle. Once you have finished paying off the loan as per the contract, the lender removes the security interest, giving you clear title to the vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Why do people use chattel mortgage business finance?</h3>\n<p>Using a chattel mortgage is a tried and tested way to afford a new vehicle for your business. It allows you to own the vehicle from the start of the loan period but instead of you having to pay out a large amount of capital, you can structure your cash flow to make it much easier to pay off. At the end of the agreement, your business then has another asset.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features?</h3>\n<p>There are a number of benefits a business can get from taking out a chattel mortgage. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flexible contract terms: </strong>These can range from one to five years (12 to 60 months).</li>\n<li><strong>Tailoring the loan to a budget: </strong>By applying a residual value (balloon) to the contract you can tailor your monthly repayments in a way that suits your budget.</li>\n<li><strong>Fixed rates: </strong>Interest rates are fixed, as are monthly repayments so you know what your costs are in advance. You can also put down a cash or trade-in deposit to reduce the principal sum to be borrowed.</li>\n<li><strong>Tax deductions: </strong>When you use the vehicle for business purposes, you can get a tax reduction, so if you are registered for Goods and Services Tax (GST) you can have an input credit on your next Business Activity Statement (BAS) by claiming the GST that the vehicle's price contains.</li>\n<li><strong>Lower interest rates: </strong>As the vehicle has the finance secured against it, interest rates will be lower.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of chattel mortgage business finance?</h3>\n<p>This type of finance enables you to buy the vehicle you want quickly and at competitive rates, with the risk being that if you fail to repay the loan in the agreed period of time you are likely to lose the vehicle and, consequently, any money you have previously repaid.</p>",,200,67,541,506,19587,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2169.25,62.0

Are you hoping to make smaller repayments from month to month? Or were you thinking more about the total amount of interest, fees and charges you&rsquo;ll pay over the lifetime of your car loan?</span></p>\n<p><span>At RateCity, you can compare different car loan options, and work out which offers from which lenders can help to save you money. What&rsquo;s more, you can learn more about which loans offer additional features that could be ideal for your financial situation, allowing you to enjoy greater value for money from your car loan. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Car loan term length</span></h3>\n<p><span>When selecting a car loan, it&rsquo;s worth considering what&rsquo;s more important to you &ndash; cheaper repayments in the short term, or paying less interest over the longer term. Some  can be paid back over the course of anywhere from one year to ten years, and the length of your loan term can have a big effect on both the affordability of your repayments, and how much interest you&rsquo;ll end up paying in total. </span></p>\n<p><span>By stretching out your loan over a longer period, you&rsquo;ll be making a larger number of repayments, each one for a smaller percentage of the car loan&rsquo;s principal, keeping your loan more affordable from month to month. But this also means being charged interest on more occasions, increasing the total amount you&rsquo;ll be paying back to the lender. </span></p>\n<p><span>Shortening the term of your car loan can make your monthly repayments more expensive, as each one will cover a greater percentage of the loan. However, the faster you can pay off your car loan, the less you&rsquo;ll pay in total interest on top of the loan&rsquo;s value. </span></p>\n<p><span>So ultimately, you&rsquo;ll have to decide what&rsquo;s more valuable to you &ndash; cheaper repayments now, or paying less in total interest on your car loan.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<h3><span>Looking at interest rates</span></h3>\n<p><span>When it comes to finding a relatively cheap car loan, comparing the advertised interest rates is the logical place to start. The lower the interest, the less you&rsquo;ll need to pay back on top of your loan, and the cheaper your monthly repayments will be. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s worth considering whether to opt for a fixed or variable interest rate on your car loan. If you find a fixed rate car loan with repayments that you can comfortably afford, you can be confident that this rate won&rsquo;t change over the term of the loan, even if rates are rising across the market. However, you also won&rsquo;t get to enjoy the savings from cheaper repayments if the lender cuts rates.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you choose a variable rate car loan, your cheap car loan repayments could get even cheaper if rates fall, though they could also become more expensive and leave you out of pocket if rates raise instead. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Comparing Comparison Rates</span></h3>\n<p><span>Even if you find the car loan with the lowest interest rate currently on the market, that&rsquo;s no guarantee you&rsquo;ll be getting the cheapest possible deal. A car loan with a low interest rate but high ongoing fees and charges may turn out to be more expensive overall than a higher interest car loan with lower fees and charges.</span></p>\n<p><span>To get a more accurate idea of the relative costs of different , check out the comparison rates, which combine each loan&rsquo;s advertised interest rate with its standard fees and charges.</span></p>\n<p><span>Keep in mind that even the comparison rate won&rsquo;t include every additional cost associated with a particular car loan, such as any nonstandard fees and charges. It&rsquo;s also worth looking beyond the comparison rate and working out whether the features and benefits of different loans will provide greater value for your money. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Secured </span></h3>\n<p><span>To enjoy cheaper monthly car loan repayments, you&rsquo;ll need a lower interest rate. To enjoy a lower interest rate, you&rsquo;ll need to reduce the lender&rsquo;s level of risk. </span></p>\n<p><span>One way to help reduce your lender&rsquo;s risk is to opt for a secured car loan, where the money you borrow is guaranteed against the value of the car you&rsquo;re buying. If you default on your loan repayments, the lender will repossess your car and sell it to reclaim its value. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders only offer secured  to borrowers who are buying new cars, or certain used car models under a certain age, to better ensure the car retains enough value to guarantee the loan. If the car you&rsquo;re buying doesn&rsquo;t fulfil this criteria, you may be able to opt for an unsecured car loan instead. While these loans can be used to purchase a greater variety of different vehicles, their interest rates can be higher than those of similar secured loans.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Cheap car loan features</span></h3>\n<p><span>If keeping the cost of your car loan down is important to you, there are a few useful features to keep an eye out for. </span></p>\n<p><span>While some lenders prefer that you pay off your car loan according to a prearranged payment plan, some will allow you to make extra repayments and get ahead of schedule. The more of your loan you pay off, the closer you&rsquo;ll get to exiting the loan early and paying less in total interest over the lifetime of the car loan. Keep in mind though that some lenders charge early exit fees if you pay your loan off early, to make up for the interest they&rsquo;d be missing out on. Make sure that paying off your car early doesn&rsquo;t accidentally cost you more than you expected!</span></p>\n<p><span>Some  are also available with a Redraw Facility &ndash; a feature that allows you to withdraw any extra money you pay onto a car loan in excess of your scheduled repayments. This added flexibility can be handy, as you&rsquo;ll be able to get ahead in paying off your car, and still remain confident that you&rsquo;ll be able to withdraw these funds again (subject to the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions) in case of emergency.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Before you buy&hellip;</span></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re taking out a car loan to buy a car that&rsquo;s had previous owners, it&rsquo;s usually worth ordering a report from the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR). Formerly known as a REVS check, this report will let you know if the car is being sold with a financial encumbrance, AKA money still owing on it from a previous owner. Some car loan providers can take care of organising this report for you as part of their service, though some will charge a small fee.</span></p>\n<p><span>Who offers cheaper  &ndash; banks or non-banks?</span></p>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re searching for a good deal on a car loan, going to a bank can often be good first step. While  from banks aren&rsquo;t always the cheapest options available, they can often provide great value, such as by bundling access to the bank&rsquo;s other financial features along with the car loan.</span></p>\n<p><span>Alternatively, non-bank lenders such as a building societies or credit unions can often offer  with competitive interest rates, as well as more flexible loan terms that can be adjusted to suit different financial situations. However, these lenders may not be able to offer as many useful features with their  as certain banks, and if you choose a non-bank lender, you won&rsquo;t have the option to drop into a branch to go through your car loan&rsquo;s terms. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Cheap  at RateCity</span></h3>\n<p><span>Finding a cheap loan for a new or used car doesn&rsquo;t have to be a struggle.

To find the best car to suit your household, it&rsquo;s often worth comparing the online and print classifieds, and taking a gander through multiple car yards, until you find that perfect set of wheels.</span></p>\n<p><span>The same principle applies when it comes to sorting out your car&rsquo;s finance. It&rsquo;s always worth looking at the car loan market and comparing not just the interest rates from different lenders, but the features and extras that could make or break your choice of car loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>You can compare a variety of different  in one place at RateCity, but it&rsquo;s worth checking that you&rsquo;re using the right information to make the most accurate comparison.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Where to start when comparing </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Before you start to compare , have a think about how much money you&rsquo;d like to borrow, how much time you&rsquo;d like to pay it back, and how much you can afford to pay back per month. While it&rsquo;s tempting to borrow the largest sum you can reasonably afford and pick up that luxury ride with all the extras, it&rsquo;s usually more sensible to opt for a slightly more modest car, so your car loan repayments can be kept fairly manageable.</span></p>\n<p><span>When working out the length of your car loan, remember that the shorter your loan term, the higher your repayments each month. However, if you go for a longer loan term with smaller monthly repayments, you&rsquo;ll find yourself paying more in total interest over your loan&rsquo;s lifetime. </span></p>\n<p><span>Also, are you buying a brand new car, or a less-expensive used car? Some lenders offer different loans for new or used cars, making it a good idea to compare your available options. New cars (any car under a certain age that&rsquo;s defined by the lender) are perceived as less financially risky compared to used cars by most lenders, so new  tend to have lower interest rates than used .&nbsp; Of course, because used cars tend to be cheaper than new cars, you shouldn&rsquo;t need to borrow quite as much money with a used car loan compared to a new car loan. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How to compare </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>The most obvious place to start comparing different  is the interest rate, which is the extra percentage you&rsquo;ll have to pay back on top of your loan repayments. Generally, the lower the interest rate, the cheaper the deal, though there are also other factors to consider when comparing different car loan offers, such as each lender&rsquo;s fees and charges. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Comparison Rate is an approximate figure that combines a loan&rsquo;s advertised interest rate with its standard fees and charges, expressed as a percentage. This comparison rate can provide a more accurate representation of a loan&rsquo;s overall cost than the interest rate alone, and can serve as a useful guideline for comparing similar , helping you determine which may be best suited to you and your finances. Remember though, not every fee is included in a car loan&rsquo;s comparison rate, nor does it account for extra features that could add further value to a loan. You can usually use comparison rates to help you narrow down your car loan choices, before you take a closer look at what each one has to offer. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Comparing Fixed Rate and Variable Rate </span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Choosing a fixed rate car loan means agreeing in advance to pay a set amount of interest on top of each monthly repayment. Because your interest rate is locked in from the start, your monthly repayments will always be the same, which is nice and simple to slot into an existing budget, especially if you want to keep your finances stable. The downside of fixing the interest rate on your car loan is that if your lender cuts its interest rates, you won&rsquo;t get to enjoy the savings. Plus, if you&rsquo;re locked into a fixed car loan plan, you may lose some flexibility in your repayment options. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you choose a variable rate car loan, your lender will adjust the interest rates they charge from month to month. If there&rsquo;s a rate cut, your repayments will go down, saving you money. But if there&rsquo;s a rate rise, your repayments will go up, costing you more. This can sometimes make budgeting for variable rate car loan repayments a little bit tricky when compared to a fixed rate car loan, though many variable rate  tend to have more flexible arrangements when it comes to making your repayments.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Comparing Secured and Unsecured </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Many  are secured loans, where the money you borrow is guaranteed against the value of an asset &ndash; usually the car you&rsquo;re purchasing. If you don&rsquo;t make your repayments, you lose the car so the lender can recover its losses. While this extra financial security means that lenders usually offer lower interest rates for secured loans, some lenders only offer these loans for particular car models, or for cars under a certain age, to better guarantee their finance against the vehicle&rsquo;s value. </span></p>\n<p><span>Unsecured loans, on the other hand, don&rsquo;t require this same level of security, and thus can typically be taken out for a greater variety of vehicle types. However, to make up for the added risk to the lender, unsecured  often have higher interest rates than their secured counterparts. </span></p>\n<p><span>When you compare secured and unsecured , consider which option will better suit your finances, and the car you&rsquo;re looking at buying.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What to look for when comparing :</span></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong><span>Early exit/extra repayment penalties</span></strong><span> &ndash; More often found on fixed rate  (which tend to have set repayment plans), but sometimes appearing on variable rate  (which often have more flexible arrangements), these fees are applied when you make extra payments on your car loan or exit the loan early, to make up for the interest payments the lender will be missing out on. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><span>Redraw facility</span></strong><span> &ndash; If you&rsquo;re able to easily make extra payments onto your car loan, a Redraw Facility will allow you to take that money back out just as easily, freeing it up for when you need some extra flexibility in your finances, subject to the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><span>Encumbrance/REVS Check Fee</span></strong><span> &ndash; If you&rsquo;re buying a used car, it&rsquo;s important to check it for any financial encumbrance, AKA money still owing on it from a previous owner. Several lenders can manage the paperwork of applying for a Personal Property Securities Register (formerly REVS) check as part of organising your car loan, though some will charge a fee for this service. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><span>100% loan</span></strong><span> &ndash; If your credit is good but your savings aren&rsquo;t as large as you&rsquo;d like, you may find yourself unable to pay the deposit required for certain . However, some loans are available with a high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), so you pay less in deposit up front, and borrow more of the car&rsquo;s value. Some lenders also offer 100% loans, where you pay no deposit up front and instead borrow the full value of the car. As these loan types represent greater financial risk to lenders compared to the other available options, they tend to have higher average interest rates. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare more </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>RateCity puts  from a range of different lenders all in one place, so you can compare what they offer side by side, saving yourself time and hassle while you get the information you need to make a more informed decision. </span></p>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;ve looked at the available rates, and have compared other features, costs and benefits being offered, you can narrow down your car loan shortlist.

Therefore, if you&rsquo;re looking for a new car, but need help paying for it, <span> in Darwin</span> could be just the ticket.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do  in Darwin work?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you need to borrow money to afford the car you want, a personal loan designed specifically for that purpose is the best way of doing so.</p>\n<p>Firstly, look into what types of  are available, as you may find some banks and other financial institutions don&rsquo;t have products you consider suitable.

You might think you&rsquo;re being offered a good deal &ndash; but if you don&rsquo;t shop around, how would you know?</p>\n<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t realise that lenders regularly offer car loan specials. Why? Well, the market is competitive and these lenders want to grow their market share. That means that if you take your time to do your research, you might discover that various lenders have unveiled limited-time specials&nbsp;that are significantly better than anything they usually offer.</p>\n<p>Some of these lenders might be offering interest rate reductions; others might be offering fee reductions. Cash rebates or gifts might also be on the menu.</p>\n<p>Whatever the offer &ndash; why wouldn&rsquo;t you at least consider it?</p>\n<h3>Special deals aren&rsquo;t always better deals</h3>\n<p>Just as you shouldn&rsquo;t jump at the first car loan you see, you also shouldn&rsquo;t jump at the first car loan special you see.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons why you want to stop and think. First, there might be better car loan specials&nbsp;out there. Second, one lender&rsquo;s special deal might actually be inferior to another lender&rsquo;s regular offer.</p>\n<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true: there are some lenders that provide such good value that they don&rsquo;t have to offer car loan specials&nbsp;to stand out from the market.</p>\n<p>So once you&rsquo;ve finished scanning this page for car loan specials, make sure you visit RateCity&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans"">online car loan comparison tool</a>. This tool will allow you to compare dozens and dozens of loans according to six different criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advertised interest rate</li>\n<li>Comparison interest rate</li>\n<li>Monthly repayment</li>\n<li>Upfront fees</li>\n<li>Ongoing fees</li>\n<li>Loan amount</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This might confirm that there are, indeed, regular car loan offers out there that are superior to the car loan specials&nbsp;currently being offered.</p>\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t let car loan lenders take you for a ride</h3>\n<p>As you peruse the car loan specials on offer, don&rsquo;t forget that conditions will almost certainly apply. For example, an interest rate reduction might be temporary; or a fee reduction might apply only if you borrow a certain amount of money. So it pays to read the fine print.</p>\n<p>You also need to understand the difference between advertised rates and comparison rates, because lenders might use a bait-and-switch trick to make a car loan special seem better than it is.</p>\n<p>The advertised rate is the interest rate you&rsquo;ll be charged. But this can give a misleading view of the damage to your wallet, because it doesn&rsquo;t include fees and charges. The comparison rate, though, does include these extra costs, which is why many people regard the comparison rate as the &lsquo;real&rsquo; interest rate.</p>\n<p>Why is that relevant? Well, a lender might triumphantly announce that it has temporarily reduced its car loan interest rate from, say, 6.50 per cent to 6.00 per cent &ndash; but its fees might be so high that the loan might have a comparison rate of 7.00 per cent. Meanwhile, another lender might offer a product that has an advertised rate of 6.20 per cent and a comparison rate of 6.40 per cent. Effectively, then, the cheaper rate would be the dearer rate and vice versa.</p>\n<h3>Spread your net even wider</h3>\n<p>There are two other ways you can go about getting a better car loan deal.</p>\n<p>First, don&rsquo;t be afraid to tell lenders that they&rsquo;ll have to lower their rate and/or reduce their fees if they want to win your business. The market is competitive, so many lenders will agree to your terms to prevent you from going to a rival. And if they don&rsquo;t &ndash; well, you haven&rsquo;t lost anything.</p>\n<p>Second, you can ask a finance broker to conduct the research and negotiations on your behalf. Brokers are finance professionals who are accredited to work with a range of lenders. Their job is to understand your unique financial circumstances and goals, and to then recommend loans that are best suited to your individual needs. Also, most finance brokers don&rsquo;t charge consumers, because they generally make their money by collecting commissions from lenders.</p>\n<p>Both the ideas mentioned above might ultimately produce a superior loan than any of the car loan specials&nbsp;currently on the market. But if they don&rsquo;t, you always have the option of taking up one of the car loan specials&nbsp;after all.</p>\n<p>The moral of the story is to do your research and take your time before signing up for a car loan. You could save hundreds of dollars in the process.</p>",,50,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,5.0,413.5

If you&rsquo;d rather not invite additional headaches and complications into your life along with your new or used set of wheels, a fixed rate car loan may be worth considering. </span></p>\n<p><span>By fixing the interest rate and repayment terms of your car loan well in advance, you can keep your personal finances under control and hopefully avoid experiencing any expensive surprises.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Why choose a fixed interest rate?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>You&rsquo;re always going to have to pay interest on your car loan in addition to the value of your car. The question is whether to pay a fixed rate of interest, which will remain the same for the lifetime of the loan, or a variable rate of interest, which will be raised or lowered by the lender according to the prevailing economic conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span>The biggest benefit of a fixed rate car loan is the simplicity and stability that it offers. By agreeing in advance to pay a fixed rate of interest, your car loan repayments will remain the same every month for the lifetime of your loan, even if the lender is otherwise raising its interest rates across the board. Every month you&rsquo;ll come one step closer to owning your car outright, and because you&rsquo;ll know exactly how much you&rsquo;ll need to pay well in advance, you can budget your finances accordingly. </span></p>\n<p><span>Keep in mind though, because these  have their interest rates fixed in advance, you won&rsquo;t get to enjoy the savings if interest rates start dropping. Choosing a variable rate car loan would allow you to benefit from these rate cuts, though they could also leave you out of pocket if you don&rsquo;t carefully budget for the possibility of your lender raising its interest rates. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Looking beyond the interest rate</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>While the car loan with lowest advertised fixed interest rate may sound appealing, it may not offer the greatest value for your household, or be the loan most suited to your unique financial situation. </span></p>\n<p><span>Even if a fixed rate car loan advertises a low interest rate, you&rsquo;ll still have to pay fees and charges in addition to the interest repayments, which could make a low-interest car loan ultimately more expensive overall than a higher-interest car loan with lower fees and charges.</span></p>\n<p><span>One way to get a better idea of a car loan&rsquo;s total costs is to check its Comparison Rate. This figure combines the loan&rsquo;s advertised interest rate with its standard fees and charges, expressing the total as an approximate percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that even a car loan with a low comparison rate may have additional nonstandard fees, charges and other costs, so it&rsquo;s worth using the comparison rate as a guideline to narrow down your choices before doing some more research to help you make your final decision. Also, when comparing different , you should look at which features and benefits they offer beyond their interest and comparison rates, and determine which of these would best match your current financial situation.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Will securing your car loan offer greater stability?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Many of the fixed rate  currently available on the Australian market are also secured , where the money that you borrow is guaranteed against the value of the car you&rsquo;re purchasing. If you default on your loan repayments, the lender will repossess and sell your car to make up for its losses. Because this arrangement reduces the lender&rsquo;s risk, you&rsquo;re more likely to enjoy a lower interest rate with a secured car loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, to help better guarantee the loan against the value of the car, some lenders will only make secured loans available to buy cars of particular makes and models, or cars under a certain age. </span></p>\n<p><span>If the car you&rsquo;re buying doesn&rsquo;t qualify for a secured loan, or if you&rsquo;d prefer not to risk potentially losing your vehicle, some lenders also offer unsecured . While these loans don&rsquo;t require additional security, they also tend to have higher interest rates, due to the increased risk to their lenders.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Want to exit your car loan early?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Imagine you&rsquo;ve taken out a car loan with a fixed interest rate, and have &nbsp;been comfortably managing your repayments. One month, you find yourself with some extra funds available, possibly from a tax refund, a bonus, or an inheritance. Why not put this extra money to good use by making an extra repayment on your car loan, or even paying the loan off entirely and making an early exit?</span></p>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, fixed rate  often also have fixed repayment plans, with fees and charges for making extra payments or exiting the loan early. Some fixed rate  will allow you to get ahead on your repayments and complete paying your loan early without penalties, but many lenders will charge the additional fees to help make up for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on if you finish your loan before its pre-set term is up. </span></p>\n<p><span>Variable rate  tend to have more flexible arrangements than many fixed rate , so if you expect you may want to put extra money towards your car loan in the future, check the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions and make your decision accordingly.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Will your money be locked into your car loan?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If your fixed rate car loan offers the flexibility to make extra repayments and get ahead on your loan, it&rsquo;s often worth checking if it also includes a Redraw Facility. This extra feature will allow you to withdraw the extra repayments you&rsquo;ve made on your car loan, subject to your lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions.</span></p>\n<p><span>The added flexibility offered by a redraw facility can be valuable if you&rsquo;re worried about tying up your spare cash in your car loan. Instead, you&rsquo;d be able to make extra repayments with confidence, knowing that the option is available to withdraw that extra cash to cover surprise expenses, just in case. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Will you need a deposit?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Paying a full security deposit on a car loan can help to reduce risk for a lender, which can in turn help you enjoy a lower interest rate on your car loan. But what if you haven&rsquo;t saved enough money to cover a full deposit on the car you want?</span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders offer high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) , where you pay a smaller deposit up front and borrow a greater percentage of the car&rsquo;s total value. Some lenders also have 100% loans available, where you borrow the full value of the car and don&rsquo;t pay a deposit at all. While these loans mean you won&rsquo;t have to save up for a deposit, they may end up costing you more from month to month, as you&rsquo;re more likely to be charged a higher interest rate to make up for the increased lender risk.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Check your car&rsquo;s finance</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re looking at reliable fixed rate  to help you avoid nasty surprises, then if the car you&rsquo;re buying has been owned before, it&rsquo;s usually worth organising a financial history report from the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR), formerly known as a REVS check. This report will inform you if the car comes with a financial encumbrance, AKA money still owing on it from a previous owner. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s possible to organise a PPSR check for yourself, though you may be able to save a little time and effort by getting your lender to look after it for you, though some lenders will charge an extra fee for this service. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare fixed rate </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Are you ready to find a car loan that suits your lifestyle? Compare  with fixed interest rates right here at RateCity, and you can enjoy consistent repayments from month to month. </span></p>\n<p><span>By selecting an affordable car loan, you&rsquo;ll be the proud owner of a shiny new (or used) set of wheels before you know it!</span></p>",,70,52,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,33.0,301.0

Or has a new addition to your family got you looking at family cars instead of two-seater sports models? Whatever car type, new or used, big or small, a car loan is the first step in helping you to secure your dream drive.</p>\n<p>You may have tainted  with the same brush as used car salesmen but rest assured, our  Guide will assist you with any questions and arm you with the knowledge to track down the best deal for you. Find out the difference between the types of loans available and how to prepare yourself when applying.</p>\n<h3>1. Loan amount</h3>\n<p>Set a budget and stick to it. We know it&rsquo;s easier said than done when you show up to a car yard looking for a Kia Rio and find yourself sitting in an Audi. However, when applying for a car loan it is important to know your loan price so that you don&rsquo;t sell yourself short by under-borrowing or adding extra financial pressure on yourself by over-borrowing.</p>\n<p>The amount you should borrow will depend on the price of the car that you wish to purchase and how much of your own money you will use towards the car. Most importantly, it will depend on what you can afford to make in repayments. Put those Audi keys down&hellip;</p>\n<p>Work out a monthly budget to see the amount of money you will be able to afford to put towards paying off your car loan. We can give you a hand with these calculations. Use our <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/calculator"">car loan repayment calculator</a> which will show you approximately what your loan repayments will be.</p>\n<p>Also keep in mind that some lenders also have a minimum and maximum amount that you can borrow so be sure to keep within their limitations.</p>\n<h3>2. Loan type</h3>\n<p>We aren&rsquo;t limited for choice when it comes to choosing a car and the same applies for . Unfortunately, this means there is no one-size-fits-all car loan, so you will have to study your options to find the right loan type for you.</p>\n<p>Get familiar with the different car loan types so you can spot the right one:</p>\n<p><strong>Variable</strong></p>\n<p>A variable car loan&rsquo;s interest rates are dependent on the lender, which means they can fluctuate and affect your repayment amount. So if your financial institution increases the interest rate, your repayments will increase; and if they decrease, so will your repayments. This type of loan is harder to budget for as your repayments may vary from month to month, however the interest rates are generally lower than fixed rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong></p>\n<p>As you might have guessed, a fixed car loan is a type of loan where the interest rate is fixed for the term of the loan, which means your repayments will always stay the same. Because of this, it is easier to budget for a fixed loan compared to a variable loan; however, fixed rates tend to be higher than variable rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Secured</strong></p>\n<p>With a secured car loan, generally the car you wish to purchase is used as an asset for security against the loan. This loan is considered a lower risk for lenders, because if you default on your repayments they can repossess your vehicle and sell it to pay off your loan. So it generally offers better interest rates than an unsecured loan.</p>\n<p><strong>Unsecured</strong></p>\n<p><a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/unsecured"">Unsecured </a> do not require the car as security against the loan. Instead, you need to prove that you can meet the repayments by showing a history of savings, or if you have previously had a loan or a credit card that you met the repayments. Some borrowers may not have the option of choosing between secured and <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/unsecured"">unsecured </a>, but with <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans"">so many to choose from on RateCity</a>, you are likely to find one that is great value and suits your requirements.</p>\n<h3>3. Fees</h3>\n<p>If you think the interest rate is the only cost of taking out a car loan, think again. Lenders might also hit you with one or several fees and charges:</p>\n<p><strong>Establishment fee</strong></p>\n<p>An establishment fee is a one-off upfront fee designed to cover the cost of setting up your car loan.</p>\n<p><strong>Early termination fee</strong></p>\n<p>You might have to pay a penalty, or early termination fee, if you pay off your loan ahead of schedule. This would be to compensate the lender for lost interest payments.</p>\n<p><strong>Balloon payment</strong></p>\n<p>Some lenders might offer to reduce your <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">monthly repayments</a> if you agree to pay a one-off lump sum &ndash; or balloon payment &ndash; at the end of the loan. The total repayments on a loan with a balloon structure is usually higher than a loan without.</p>\n<h3>4. Car type</h3>\n<p>Are you looking for a new car or a used car? The type of car you choose and the age of the car will determine what type of car loan you may require.</p>\n<p><strong>New car loan</strong></p>\n<p>So you have your eye on a sparkling new car?

A new car loan is a type of personal loan available to fund the purchase of your new car. With this type of loan, there are usually conditions about the age of the car that you wish to purchase. These will differ between financial institutions. Some may offer <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/new-cars"">new </a> to brand new cars only, while some may consider a new car no more than two years old or with a certain number of kilometres on the clock.</p>\n<p>The great news for new car buyers is lower interest rates. The interest rates for <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/new-cars"">new </a> are usually a bit lower than a used car loan as this type of loan is seen as less risky to the lender because new cars generally have higher resale value than older models.</p>\n<p><strong>Used car loan</strong></p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve decided to purchase a pre-loved vehicle? A used car loan will allow you to borrow money in order to purchase a used car only. Depending on the financial institution, there may be restrictions on the age of the car in order to be eligible. For example, some may offer this type of loan to cars that are between two to five years old. Always check with your lender for terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>The other major difference between a used car loan and a new car loan is that interest rates may be a little higher for <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/used-cars"">used </a>. But like a new car loan, there are also a range of secured and unsecured <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/used-cars"">used </a> available to choose from.</p>\n<h3>5. Preferred features</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s the fine print that really requires your attention. When narrowing down your car loan options, make sure you look into the loan features. There are a range of features attached to , which are all specific to the type of loan and the lender.</p>\n<p>Some of the preferred features are:</p>\n<p><strong>No early exit penalty</strong></p>\n<p>If you come into extra money and want to pay off your loan early, before the end of the term, you want to know that you can do so without being penalised. This will differ between lenders and the loan type you apply for so make sure you enquire about this feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra repayments</strong></p>\n<p>Can you make extra payments off your car loan? Doing so will allow you to pay off the loan sooner and save money to boot. To find out about this feature, ask your prospective lender if your car loan allows extra repayments, if you will be charged for doing so and if there is a limit on how many repayments you can make within a certain time frame. These are the finer details you should find out before applying for a loan.</p>\n<h3>6. Checklist</h3>\n<p>The dreaded paperwork. It&rsquo;s a tedious part of life but a necessary process we can&rsquo;t avoid. We&rsquo;ve tried to make it easier for you by putting together a checklist of some of the documentation that you may need to support your car loan application.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s time to prove yourself. Usually when applying for a loan you need to provide identification in accordance with the ID check system. Have your driver&rsquo;s license or passport ready as well as your birth certificate and Medicare card, or two additional cards with your name and photo on them, to prove you are who you say you are.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact details</strong></p>\n<p>It sounds silly that you wouldn&rsquo;t know your own number, but you don&rsquo;t call yourself, do you? Make sure you have all of your contact details on you, such as address and phone numbers, so that you don&rsquo;t slow down the application process.</p>\n<p>** Copies of bank statements **</p>\n<p>Most lenders will ask for copies of your bank statements from the past few months to see that you have a savings history. If you no longer receive paper statements, you can still log into your internet banking and print them out or even email them to your lender.</p>\n<p><strong>Credit history records</strong></p>\n<p>Be prepared for your credit history to be studied. While it can feel a little intrusive, a credit check is a comprehensive way for lenders to determine if you are going to be able to make the loan repayments. If you have any credit cards or other loans, they may ask to see copies of the past few statements for evidence that you can meet the repayments and have not defaulted. If you&rsquo;ve never held a loan or a credit card before, don&rsquo;t worry: proof of income and any bills such as phone or electricity and even rental payment receipts can all count towards your credit history.</p>\n<p><strong>Proof of income</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, your word doesn&rsquo;t carry the same weight it would have in the old days. In order to prove you earn the amount that you state on your application, you will need to provide pay slips from the past few months. If you don&rsquo;t have copies of these, you may be able to use your most recent tax return or group certificates. However, check with your lender to see if they will accept these.</p>\n<p><strong>Car details</strong></p>\n<p>If you are using the car to secure against the loan, you will need to provide details of the car such as registration and engine number. If you buy it from a dealer, you may need to provide details as your lender may need to make a cheque directly to the dealer. You may also need a copy of the receipt when you purchase it to prove the cost.</p>\n<h3>7. Car loan jargon</h3>\n<p>One of the difficult things about finding a car loan is trying to make sense of all the confusing finance talk.</p>\n<p>So to make your life easier, we&rsquo;ve compiled a list of terms you might encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Loan term</strong></p>\n<p>The loan term is the amount of time the lender gives you to repay the car loan. For example, a loan with a five-year loan term would have to be paid off within five years.</p>\n<p><strong>Advertised rate</strong></p>\n<p>This is the headline interest rate. It doesn&rsquo;t include fees and charges, so it might understate how much money you would have to repay over the life of the loan.</p>\n<p><strong>Comparison rate</strong></p>\n<p>This is the &lsquo;real&rsquo; interest rate, because it combines the advertised rate with any fees and charges. The comparison rate is calculated based on a loan of $30,000 over five years, so it might be a little inaccurate if you borrow a different amount or have a different loan term.</p>\n<p><strong><a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/how-much-can-i-borrow"">Borrowing capacity</a></strong></p>\n<p>This is the amount of money you can borrow from a particular lender. Your <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/how-much-can-i-borrow"">borrowing capacity</a> might vary from lender to lender, because each institution uses its own in-house formulas. Also, your <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/how-much-can-i-borrow"">borrowing capacity</a> might might differ from that of your friends and family, because each consumer&rsquo;s circumstances are unique.</p>\n<p><strong>LVR</strong></p>\n<p>The LVR, or loan-to-value ratio, is a percentage that expresses the amount of money owed on the car compared to the value of the car. For example, if you took out a $15,000 loan to buy a $20,000 car, you would an LVR of 75 per cent.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-approval</strong></p>\n<p>A pre-approval is a formal document stating how much credit a lender will give you once you&rsquo;ve found the car you want to buy. Please note that a pre-approval is not a contract, so the lender is under no obligation to follow through.</p>\n<p><strong>Principal</strong></p>\n<p>This is the value of the loan that is still outstanding. So if a borrower takes out a $20,000 loan, the principal is $20,000. If the borrower repays $5,000 in the first year, the principal is now $15,000.</p>\n<p><strong>Redraw facility</strong></p>\n<p>A redraw facility allows you to access any funds you may have repaid ahead of schedule &ndash; although conditions and fees often apply. Not all  come with a redraw facility.</p>\n<p><strong>Finance broker</strong></p>\n<p>A finance broker is a middleman who can help you organise a car loan with a range of lenders. Brokers generally don&rsquo;t charge for their services; instead, they receive commission payments from lenders.</p>\n<p><strong>Salary packaging</strong></p>\n<p>This is an arrangement you can make with your employer to buy a car from your pre-tax salary. The advantage of salary packaging is that it will reduce your taxable income.</p>\n<h3>8. Other paperwork</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, the car loan and car purchase aren&rsquo;t the only costs you&rsquo;ll face.</p>\n<p>Here are four other things that will have you reaching for your wallet:</p>\n<p><strong>Compulsory third-party insurance</strong></p>\n<p>Compulsory third-party insurance, or CTP insurance, is compulsory. If you&rsquo;re responsible for a car accident, your compulsory third-party insurance will be used to pay any compensation due to anyone who might be injured or killed. However, compulsory third-party insurance won&rsquo;t cover you for vehicle damage or theft.</p>\n<p><strong>Comprehensive insurance</strong></p>\n<p>Comprehensive insurance protects you if you&rsquo;re responsible for a car accident. Policies vary from provider to provider, but comprehensive insurance generally covers you for damage to your car and property, as well as the other parties&rsquo; cars and property. A comprehensive insurance policy may also protect you from theft, vandalism and natural disasters.</p>\n<p><strong><a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/calculators/stamp-duty-calculator"">Stamp duty</a></strong></p>\n<p><a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/calculators/stamp-duty-calculator"">Stamp duty</a>, or motor vehicle duty, is a tax you pay when you transfer a car into your name. <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/calculators/stamp-duty-calculator"">Stamp duty</a> applies to both new and used cars. <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/calculators/stamp-duty-calculator"">Stamp duty</a> is a state tax, so rates and conditions vary from state to state: <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.revenue.nsw.gov.au/taxes/vehicle"">New South Wales</a></span>, <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sro.vic.gov.au/calculators/motor-vehicle-duty-calculator"">Victoria</a></span>, <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/registration/fees/duty/calculator"">Queensland</a></span>, <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.finance.wa.gov.au/cms/State_Revenue/Duties/Vehicle_Licence_Duty.aspx"">Western Australia</a></span>, <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.revenuesa.sa.gov.au/taxes-and-duties/stamp-duties/motor-vehicles"">South Australia</a></span>, <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/fees_forms/registration_licensing/duty_rates"">Tasmania</a></span>, <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.revenue.act.gov.au/motor-vehicle-duty"">ACT</a></span> and <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.treasury.nt.gov.au/TaxesRoyaltiesAndGrants/StampDuty/StampDutyCalculators/Pages/MVR-Duty.aspx"">Northern Territory</a></span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Pink slip</strong></p>\n<p>A pink slip is another name for the safety check that needs to be done before a car owner can renew the vehicle&rsquo;s registration.</p>\n<p><strong>Start comparing a great range of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/low-interest"">low-interest </a> now.</strong></p>",,0,8,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,4.0,433.5

That&rsquo;s why many Hobartians have a car, as it means not only can they get around the city for both work and leisure, but also head into the countryside or to the coast at the weekend and for holidays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A new car can make doing that a lot easier and more comfortable for you and your family, and <span> in Hobart</span> can make buying the car of your dreams a reality.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do  in Hobart work?</strong></h3>\n<p>Borrowing money always has a cost, and buying a car may be largest purchase you ever make apart from buying a home.  are a type of personal loan, and therefore they have similar features to regular personal loans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Loans in Australia are carefully regulated by two financial bodies, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), so you can be confident that charges won&rsquo;t be excessive and that you&rsquo;ll be protected if anything should go wrong with the institution lending to you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your loan application is accepted, you will enter into a binding agreement to repay not only the principal loan for your car but the interest accrued over the loan term.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use  in Hobart?</strong></h3>\n<p>Cars are costly, so negotiate with car dealers with your eyes wide open. You may not have sufficient funds in terms of the value of your current car and/or savings you intend to put towards your new car, but try to negotiate a deal that suits your circumstances.</p>\n<p>If you want to push the boat out then go for it, if you feel you can afford it; remember that most car dealers would rather strike a deal than have you walk away.

If unsecured, your chosen lender will want to be sure you can repay the loan, so good credit history will be needed here.

It may be that you will need a letter from an accountant to support your application.</p>\n<p>Low doc  may be either secured or unsecured, and if security is required, often you can use the value of your car or your home.

At RateCity, not only can you compare car loan interest rates side by side, but also get a better idea of the fees, charges, and other benefits of each lender, in order to make a more informed decision.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Consider the Comparison Rate</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>While one of the simplest ways to find a cheap deal on a car loan is to compare the advertised interest rates, these may not accurately reflect the total cost you&rsquo;ll likely end up paying on top of your car&rsquo;s value. A low interest car loan with high ongoing fees and charges may end up ultimately costing you more than a higher interest car loan with lower fees and charges. </span></p>\n<p><span>Enter the Comparison Rate. This figure combines a car loan&rsquo;s interest rate with its standard fees and charges, and expresses them as a single percentage that offers a more accurate estimation of how much extra you may end up paying back on your car loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>Remember that a car loan&rsquo;s comparison rate only summarises its standard fees and charges, and may leave out other costs associated with a particular loan. Also, the comparison rate doesn&rsquo;t account for the extra features and benefits that could influence your decision, so be sure to do a little extra research settling on a low interest car loan.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Securing a low interest car loan</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>To get the lowest possible interest rate on your car loan, you&rsquo;ll need to prove that you&rsquo;re a relatively safe risk for the lender. Having a stable income and a good credit history can be a big help, but so is opting for a Secured Car Loan. &nbsp;In this arrangement, the balance you borrow is guaranteed against the value of the car you&rsquo;re buying. Even if a borrower doesn&rsquo;t pay back a lender, the lender can still make up this loss by repossessing and selling the borrower&rsquo;s car. This extra financial security for lenders often translates into lower interest rates for borrowers.</span></p>\n<p><span>That said, qualifying for a secured car loan isn&rsquo;t always easy, as lenders want to be confident that the car&rsquo;s value will cover the financial losses of a potential default. Thus, secured  may not be available for certain car models, or cars over a certain age, depending on the lender. </span></p>\n<p><span>If the car you&rsquo;re looking at doesn&rsquo;t qualify for a secured car loan, or if you&rsquo;d prefer not to risk potentially losing your car if repaying your car loan becomes a problem, you could instead opt for an unsecured car loan, which will likely have a higher interest rate. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Fixed vs variable interest rates</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Once you find a car loan with an interest rate and/or comparison rate that&rsquo;s low enough to afford, you may want to make sure that it will stay affordable. If you choose a low interest car loan with a fixed interest rate, the amount of interest you&rsquo;ll pay on your car loan will be set in advance and remain in place for the lifetime of the loan. Even if there are rate rises across the market across the market, your interest rate will remain the same, with every repayment bringing you one step closer to owning your car outright.</span></p>\n<p><span>A consistently low car loan interest rate sounds pretty good, but what if your interest rate could get even lower? A variable interest rate on your car loan is adjusted from month to month by the lender. If rates are cut, your repayments may shrink, saving you even more money. Of course, interest rates could also rise, and bring up your repayments with them. This can make preparing your budget in advance more challenging, and leave you at risk of finding yourself out of pocket. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Can you pay less interest by repaying your loan faster?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If one of the reasons you&rsquo;re looking for a car loan with a low interest rate is to avoid paying a lender too much more on top of your car&rsquo;s value, it&rsquo;s often worth considering making additional payments on your car loan. By getting ahead in your car loan repayments, you&rsquo;ll be bringing yourself closer to getting it fully paid off and making an early exit from the loan, which should reduce the total amount of interest you&rsquo;ll need to pay over the lifetime of your loan, saving you money. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, this isn&rsquo;t a valid options for every car loan and financial situation. Some lenders charge fees for making additional repayments or exiting a loan early, to compensate for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on. Fixed rate  tend to carry more restrictions, often locking borrowers into tight repayment plans. Variable rate  tend to have more flexible repayment arrangements, though some lenders do still charge these fees.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Do you want a car loan with added flexibility?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>If your low interest car loan allows you to easily make extra repayments, there&rsquo;s sometimes an added benefit beyond just bringing you closer to exiting your loan early. If your car loan also includes a Redraw Facility, you&rsquo;ll be able to pull the extra money you&rsquo;ve paid onto your car loan back out again if required (subject to the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions), such as when a surprise financial emergency leaves you needing some cash back in your pocket. </span></p>\n<p><span>As well as adding extra flexibility to your car loan, a redraw facility can help you make those extra repayments with confidence &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be able to get ahead in your loan without locking up your spare cash in your loan and losing access to it altogether. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Will you need a deposit?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re hoping to get a low interest rate on your car loan, you&rsquo;re more than likely going to need to pay the full deposit required by your lender, to better ensure your loan&rsquo;s security and reduce the lender&rsquo;s financial risk. While some lenders offer loans with a higher Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) that only require smaller deposits, or 100% loans, which require no deposits, these loans represent higher financial risks to their lenders, which means higher interest rates. So if you have your heart set on a low interest car loan, it&rsquo;s usually worth making sure you have some savings available for a deposit. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Checking your car&rsquo;s financial history</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re buying a car that&rsquo;s been owned before, even if it&rsquo;s young enough to count as &ldquo;new&rdquo; for the purpose of taking out a car loan, it&rsquo;s usually worth applying for a report on its financial history from the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR), formerly known as a REVS check. This will let you know if the car still has money owing on it from a previous owner, AKA a financial encumbrance. While you can organise one of these reports yourself, you may be able to save a bit of time and hassle by having your lender handle it for you while they&rsquo;re organising your loan, though some lenders may charge a fee for this service. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare low interest </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>At RateCity, you can find a wide range of  available from a variety of lenders, and organise your options to find the  offering the lowest advertised interest rates and comparison rates.</span></p>\n<p><span>Remember though that a low interest rate shouldn&rsquo;t be all that you look for on your car loan &ndash; take a closer look at the features and benefits offered by different lenders to work out which car loan will provide you with the most value for your financial situation. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>",,1300,623,2874,1771,117424,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,12880.650000000001,31.0

If you have your own transport, you and all the family can take in the museums, galleries and theatre shows of your choice, or take trips to the mountains or the beaches to make the most of your leisure time.</p>\n<h3>How do  in Melbourne work?</h3>\n<p>As in other Australian cities, the personal loans market in Melbourne is competitive, keeping interest rates low. You can apply for a car loan via a wide range of financial institutions, plus there are also online companies that handle loan queries from their potential customers remotely.</p>\n<p>Depending on your status and personal preferences, you can apply for a <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/ratings"">Melbourne car loan</a></span> that is secured, for example on your car, home or other property. This can be a slightly cheaper option compared to seeking out an unsecured loan.</p>\n<p>A pre-approved car loan will enable you to arrange finance before choosing your vehicle, which is very useful if you haven't quite made up your mind yet. Be prepared to have your credit history checked, and&nbsp;to negotiate with your lender if you want to make adjustments to your car loan&rsquo;s terms.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features of  in Melbourne?</h3>\n<p>Lenders offer a range of different types of  at fixed or variable interest rates. They may also suggest features such as flexible repayments, arrange balloon payments, or choose loans with particularly low interest rates. If you happen to be a pensioner, single parent or student, you may find that some companies will have special deals tailored to your level of income.</p>\n<p>A flexible payment system allows you to make more than the minimum payment from time to time. This means you might be able to repay your loan early, however, sometimes lenders place a restriction on how often you can do this, or charge additional fees when you do.</p>\n<p>A balloon payment system means you can make smaller regular repayments and a much larger one at the end of the loan period. Alternatively, you can often refinance your vehicle to repay the final instalment.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons?</h3>\n<p>To get a better deal, use the comparison rate instead of the lender&rsquo;s advertised rate. The comparison rate factors in any additional charges and fees that are applicable to each loan offer, thereby giving you a more accurate illustration of the true cost of each loan. Use a loan calculator to help you to work out the monthly payments you will need to make.</p>\n<p>Read your car loan agreement carefully before making a commitment to avoid running the risk of defaulting on your payments, which could ultimately damage your credit history.</p>",,320,0,0,0,8,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,32.8,302.0

Motorbikes conjure up the freedom of endless roads and wide-open spaces, things that Australia has no shortage of. As with any type of vehicle, you can get relatively inexpensive bikes or go to the top of the range where you could spend many thousands of dollars, even over $30,000 to get the bike you want. If you can't afford all the money up front, motorbike finance could be the solution.</p>\n<h4><strong>How does motorbike finance work?</strong></h4>\n<p>When you need money to finance buying your motorbike you will be entering into a loan agreement with a bank or other financial organisation. Motorbike finance is a type of personal loan where you borrow money, just as you would for a car, a caravan or other large value item. You will generally be offered a fixed rate of interest to pay on top of the principal sum you are being loaned, and you can decide over how many years you want to pay it back. Normally there is a maximum time period <span>of 60 months&nbsp;</span>for this type of loan. If you choose to repay more quickly, you'll be saving on interest payments.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why do people use motorbike finance?</strong></h4>\n<p>Getting help to finance your motorbike means the opportunity to own your bike more quickly than if you had to save up for it. Even bikes at the cheaper end of the market may cost several thousand dollars, so as often as not, you'll need that extra help to buy one. If you currently have a bike you can trade in, you can reduce the amount you have to borrow, and if you have some savings to put towards it as well, you can save money on the amount of interest to be repaid.</p>\n<h4><strong>What are the main features?</strong></h4>\n<p>As a type of personal loan, the majority of institutions in the financial sector provide motorbike finance options. If you are looking for a short-term loan, you should always check out the interest rates being offered by a variety of lenders. Rates do vary and can be higher than if you took out a loan over a longer period. However, even though that could help your cash flow in terms of smaller repayments, you could end up paying much more in interest than with a shorter loan. Make comparisons between lenders that will suit your circumstances.</p>\n<h4><strong>What are the pros and cons of motorbike finance?</strong></h4>\n<p>When you enter into a personal loan for motorbike finance, you should always check what your overall cost would be and if there are any hidden fees, such as for applying, overpaying and early repayment. A loan will give you the freedom to buy the motorbike you want without having to wait. You need to ensure you can afford the monthly repayments without them becoming a financial headache. If you fail to repay instalments on time or default completely, then you are likely to lose your bike.</p>",,5,33,246,255,17758,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1867.9500000000003,68.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the  that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><span>New </span></h1>\n<p><span>There&rsquo;s nothing quite like a brand new car. The look, the feel, the unmistakable new car smell&hellip; Even if a new car costs a bit more to buy, it&rsquo;s often money well spent. </span></p>\n<p><span>To help you achieve your dream of impressing your friends by showing off your brand new car, RateCity has a variety of  available to compare from a range of different lenders. Several of these  are intended specifically for new car purchases, so it&rsquo;s worth learning more about the available options and making sure you choose a new car loan that perfectly suits your finances. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What counts as a &ldquo;new&rdquo; or &ldquo;used&rdquo; car?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Different lenders use different definitions to determine whether a car counts as New or Used for the purpose of offering finance, usually based on the car&rsquo;s age. </span></p>\n<p><span>For example, a lender may count any car less than 2 years old as &ldquo;new&rdquo;, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s coming straight from the factory, or if it&rsquo;s had previous owners. The same lender may consider any vehicle more than 2 years old as &ldquo;used&rdquo;, and thus offer different terms and conditions when offering a car loan. Some lenders also have a maximum age for used cars that they&rsquo;ll offer finance for. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What are the benefits of a new car loan?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Lenders tend to consider new cars to be significantly less financially risky than used cars. Because new cars are, well, NEW, they haven&rsquo;t experienced the same kind of wear and tear as used cars, so they&rsquo;re far less likely to break down and end up written off over the lifetime of a loan. What&rsquo;s more, new cars are more likely to be sold at regulated dealers with full warranties in place, giving these vehicles additional security against defects.</span></p>\n<p><span>What does this all mean for you? Well, because new cars represent less risk, many lenders will offer more favourable terms and conditions for new , with lower interest rates and greater flexibility than for used . </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Are there drawbacks to new ? </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Because new cars tend to be more expensive than used cars, taking out a new car loan often means saving up a bigger deposit and/or borrowing more money to buy your vehicle. Depending on your financial situation, a larger loan may take longer to pay back, which may mean paying more in interest over the lifetime of the loan.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Interest Rates and Comparison Rates</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>New  tend to generally have lower interest rates than comparable used , due to the reduced risk they present to lenders. It&rsquo;s still worth shopping around for a new car loan with a low interest rate, so you can enjoy lower repayments over the lifetime of your loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, interest isn&rsquo;t the only extra cost you may need to pay for a new car loan &ndash; there are also fees and charges to consider. These vary by lender and can be add hundreds to your loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>That&rsquo;s why RateCity has a list of car lenders&rsquo; application fees for your convenience. To get an accurate representation of what you would likely pay for the new car loan, consider both fees and interest. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Fixed Rate vs Variable Rate</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Would you prefer to keep the repayments on your car loan stable from month to month, even if it means potentially missing out on some savings and flexibility? </span></p>\n<p><span>A fixed rate car loan is worth considering if you want to prepare your budget in advance. By fixing your interest rate and repayment amounts at the start of your loan&rsquo;s term, you can enjoy the security of knowing that every month will bring you one step closer a fully paid off new car, even when interest rates are rising across the market. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, because fixing your interest rate in advance often also means agreeing to a pre-set repayment plan, you may not have the option available to pay your loan off early, even if you find yourself with extra money available further down the line.</span></p>\n<p><span>A variable rate car loan has an interest rate that may rise or fall from month to month. If your lender passes on a rate cut, your payments may go down that month, allowing you to save a little money, or possibly get a bit ahead on your loan repayments. But if rates rise, you could find yourself coming up short against the higher repayments. This can make preparing a budget in advance a bit more challenging than with a fixed rate car loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>Also, since variable rate  don&rsquo;t lock you into the same kind of pre-set payment plans as many fixed rate loans, they&rsquo;re more likely to offer greater flexibility in how you make your loan repayments and access additional benefits.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Early exit/extra repayment penalties</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you ever find yourself with money to spare, such as if you receive a tax refund or a bonus payout from work, or if a cut to your car loan&rsquo;s variable interest rate means a smaller repayment than you expected this month, it&rsquo;s worth thinking about putting some extra money onto your car loan. By getting your car loan paid off quickly and making an early exit, you may be able to ultimately pay less total interest on your new car. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, not all  include an option to make extra repayments or early exits, with some lenders charging fees for doing so, to make up for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on. Fixed rate loans for new cars tend to have more restrictions around extra repayments than variable rate , though you should always check the terms and conditions to be sure.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Redraw Facility</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>If your lender makes it easy to pay extra money onto your car loan, but a financial emergency comes up and you could really use that extra money back in your pocket again, it&rsquo;s good to know whether your car loan includes a Redraw Facility. This feature provides the flexibility to take any extra money you&rsquo;ve paid onto your loan back out again with minimal fuss, subject to the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Encumbrance/REVS Check Fee</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Even if you&rsquo;re buying a car that&rsquo;s young enough to count as a new car to a lender, unless you&rsquo;re buying it brand new straight off the showroom floor, it could still have money owing on it (aka a financial encumbrance) from a previous owner. </span></p>\n<p><span>To avoid surprises when buying a used car, even if it&rsquo;s relatively new, it&rsquo;s usually worth organising a report from the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR), formerly known as a REVS check. You can organise this yourself, though many lenders can handle it for you when preparing your car loan, with some charging a fee for the service.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>100% loan</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Because new cars can sometimes be a little pricier than similar used cars, it&rsquo;s not always easy to save up the full deposit required for a new car loan. But there are options available if your heart is set on that one particular new car. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders offer high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) , which only require smaller deposits, and have you borrow a greater percentage of the car&rsquo;s value. There are also 100% loans available from some lenders, which need no deposit, and instead have you borrow the new car&rsquo;s full value. Because of the relatively high risk to the lender, these loans tend to have higher interest rates than other new .</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare new </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Ready to make a decision and choose a loan to help you buy a new car? RateCity lets you compare new  side by side and work out which ones will better suit your personal financial needs. </span></p>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;ve examined your options and have an idea of which lenders are offering the type of loans you want, you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to driving home in your new car, with your finances under control. </span></p>",,480,206,781,746,140218,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,14401.85,28.0

However, in Australia, the National Consumer Credit Protection act requires lenders to loan money responsibly, so credit checks are required by all responsible lenders.</p>\n<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you won&rsquo;t be able to get a car loan, however. There are lenders who understand that bad credit situations happen, and also that in many cases it's no fault of the individual, but is instead due to unexpected circumstances. You may have lost your job or have unforeseen medical bills to pay. You may need a car to enable you to take a particular job, so it's worth exploring what could be available to you if your credit rating is poor.</p>\n<h3>How do no credit check loans work?</h3>\n<p>Traditional lenders, such as banks, will look at your credit rating after you have jumped through all the other hoops, and if they see it's bad, they are unlikely to offer you a car loan. While no credit check  aren&rsquo;t valid options from many Australian lenders, there are  that can be tailored to an individual's specific needs, and could be available even if you have been bankrupt in the past. You will usually need to show evidence of income through your work and have a bank account, and a lender will then calculate how much it is prepared to let you borrow. After that, it's just the same as taking out a personal loan in that you will have to pay back the principal sum borrowed together with interest and, where necessary, any fees for setting up or managing the account.</p>\n<h3>Why do people use no credit check loans?</h3>\n<p>If you need a car loan but find the normal routes to borrowing are closed off to you because of your low credit rating, while it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll be able to responsibly apply for a no credit check car loan, there are alternative places to go. It doesn't mean you are guaranteed a loan, as this will depend on your circumstances, but it could be exactly what you need at what may be a difficult time.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features?</h3>\n<p>In common with any personal loan, you can do initial research into what is available online when it comes to bad credit , as opposed to no credit check . If you are eligible, you can make comparisons between interest rates, the length of time you will have to pay back the loan, and what fees, if any, are charged. These types of  usually have higher interest rates than standard  but if a lender is happy that you have the means to pay back what you've borrowed, they are more likely to make you an offer.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of no credit check ?</h3>\n<p>Having a bad credit rating isn't the end of the world when searching for a car loan, and while no credit check  aren&rsquo;t usually valid options, there are alternatives to choose from. Be aware that interest rates, especially for short-term , can be very high and that you should factor this in when you make car loan comparisons.</p>",,720,86,287,268,27161,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2914.3500000000004,54.0

One method that can be particularly useful for you as an employee, and for your employer too, is <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/calculator"">novated leasing.</a></span> This type of leasing is often thought to be solely for business owners or for fleet cars, but that isn't the case. Novated leasing is an alternative way of financing a car that anyone can take advantage of, and can give tax benefits that significantly reduce the net cost of purchasing and running a car.</p>\n<h3>How does novated leasing work?</h3>\n<p>Novated leasing works when a lender facilitates an arrangement between you and your employer so you can divert some of your income before it is taxed towards buying your car and the costs of running it, which could mean considerable savings for you. You can benefit even if you don't own a business, only want the car for private use and have a low annual mileage. You could also use a novated lease to buy a used car, and you can take advantage of one whatever your level of income.</p>\n<h3>Why do people use novated leasing?</h3>\n<p>Saving money is the primary goal of most car buyers, and if you're saving tax at the same time, then it may well be worth exploring your options with lenders and your employer. When an agreement is set up between the three parties, your employer will make salary deductions for your regular lease payments that will be a combination of your income pre-tax and post-tax.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features?</h3>\n<p>Novated leasing means you can get the car you need while also saving tax. You can get your car running costs bundled into the lease deal, so as well as the purchase price, your single salary deduction can include fuel, insurance, maintenance and tyres. You can maximise your tax savings and cut out the hassle when you have to budget for your running costs. As with any form of car leasing, you should compare the options available and be comfortable about interest rates being charged, any fees or hidden expenses in the package, and that you can afford to have a part of your salary taken as a repayment every month.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of novated leasing?</h3>\n<p>Novated leasing can be an ideal way to purchase the vehicle that best suits your work and personal circumstances, while enjoying tax benefits. It's important to examine the small print of any deal, and to discuss with your employer and the finance company what the implications are in terms of interest rates and lease term. You should also check on the eligibility of the vehicle, the kilometres you will travel and other factors to ensure you will be entitled to tax concessions.</p>",,5,26,404,420,10851,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1222.2,92.0

There aren't many of us who have several thousand dollars lying around just ready to go and buy a new or second-hand vehicle. You might have a family and be paying a mortgage or rent, not to mention your regular household bills. If you're relatively young and starting out in the world of work, you may not have much, if anything, in the way of personal savings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So how are you going to get that car you need? By exploring <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/best"">online car loan approval</a></span> before you even set foot in a car dealership.</p>\n<p><strong>How does online car loan approval work?</strong></p>\n<p>If you haven't got cash upfront to pay for a car, you will be part of very large majority, and you'll need an alternative way to finance your purchase. When you walk into a dealership with nothing in place financially, you could be walking into a situation where you will be offered finance that is not necessarily the best deal available.</p>\n<p>Instead of possibly being exposed to high interest rates coupled with fees, you may be able to get a much more favourable deal by opting for online car loan approval. You fill in an online application that will determine the amount you can borrow. This is based on your income and will also factor in any debts you have, so be as certain as possible that you will be able to afford the monthly repayment amount without defaulting. If your credit history and income is favourable, you could get pre-approval for a loan, perhaps with a very good interest rate, before you head for the showroom.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do people use online car loan approval?</strong></p>\n<p>It's a very straightforward way of finding out how much money you could borrow to go towards your car purchase. You may have some savings or a car to trade in as a deposit &ndash; you're likely to have to find a deposit for most purchases anyway &ndash; but people use this method so they can accurately assess what type of car they can afford.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the main features?</strong></p>\n<p>These are personal loans, and you may or may not be asked for security, depending on how much the loan is for. The advantage of doing the online work beforehand is that not only do you know what your borrowing limit is, but you will also know what your monthly repayments will be and over what period of time. This allows you to be in a stronger negotiating position with the dealership because you will be able to pay for the car without involving their finance. &nbsp;This presents the potential to save you money by getting a better deal, because you are to all intents and purposes a cash buyer.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the pros and cons of online car loan approval?</strong></p>\n<p>The positive aspect of online car loan approval is that you know in advance what your purchase limit is, and that when approved, the loan is effectively guaranteed. As with any personal loan, you must be sure you can pay it back on time with regular payments, or you could be in a position where the car is repossessed and you have nothing to show for the money you have paid out.</p>",,5,0,3,1,131,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,14.200000000000001,355.0

If you're in this position, there is no reason not to explore your options, and many lenders will assess your financial circumstances to examine your eligibility. <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/calculator""> for pensioners</a></span> are personal loans, and when assessing your situation, lenders will look at all your financial details, including your credit history, the value of your assets (including your home if you own one) and what type of pension you receive. Pensioners with assets can be quite an attractive prospect for a lender, as a car loan could be secured on a home.</p>\n<h3>How do  for pensioners work?</h3>\n<p>A personal loan works the same way for pensioners as for anyone else, in that you borrow an amount of money to pay for your car, and then repay that amount with interest over a number of months or years. One to five years is usual, but you could get up to seven years depending on the lender and the amount you want to borrow. Putting down a deposit or trading in an older car will reduce the principal sum you&rsquo;ll be loaned, and consequently reduce the repayments. Interest rates will vary, so you should make comparisons between lenders &ndash; a loan comparison calculator is a handy online tool.</p>\n<h3>Why do people use  for pensioners?</h3>\n<p>You may have assets in terms of savings or investments, as well as a home, where your money is tied up and you don't have the capital available to buy a car outright. So when you want a new or used car to replace what you have, a car loan will give you the freedom to buy one and plan your monthly repayments to suit your income and budget. Some lenders may be flexible and permit fortnightly or even weekly repayments, but you should work out what best fits your financial circumstances.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features?</h3>\n<p> are much shorter term than home loans, and it's why you should take the time to research and compare what is available, paying attention to interest rates, any upfront or ongoing fees, and checking if there are penalties for paying the loan off early. Some loans will offer lower repayments, but leave a residual &ndash; or balloon &ndash; payment that has to be paid off at the end of the loan before you can own the car outright. If you don't have the money available to cover this final payment, there is the option of refinancing and taking out a new loan to pay it off.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of  for pensioners?</h3>\n<p>Getting what you want immediately rather than waiting is a benefit of getting a car loan for a pensioner. If you have a loan secured on your property, you will be likely to get a lower interest rate, but make sure you repay on time so you don't face the prospect of the car being repossessed by the lender.</p>",,1000,171,724,717,13832,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1784.85,72.0

Companies that specialise in online loans have a particularly fast turnaround time and are able to respond promptly to applications. Whether you want a car, a caravan or motorcycle, you should be able to find a loan deal that suits.</p>\n<p>When comparing loan offers, note whether lenders require loans to be secured, for example on your car, home or other property, or whether they are happy to offer unsecured loans. If you don't yet know what type of vehicle you want, you can apply for a pre-approved loan so you&rsquo;ll know the finance will be available when you need it.

If you are a pensioner, single parent or student, some companies will tailor their loan arrangements to suit your level of income.</p>\n<p>A flexible payment system allows you to repay your loan early by occasionally paying more than the minimum amount.

Loan approval is normally a fairly speedy process, so you should know how much you can afford to spend promptly.</p>\n<p>Always take the time to read your car loan agreement carefully, and make sure you know exactly how much the loan will cost you before making a commitment. If you don&rsquo;t, you run the risk of being unable to maintain payments, which could cause you to default on the loan and damage your credit history.</p>",,5,0,0,0,40,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,4.5,422.0

With so many car loan options to choose from, rating the available offers and working out which ones will most ideally suit your finances can sometimes be tricky.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span> can be rated by their interest rates, fees and charges, features and benefits, and their flexibility. By rating  by each of these categories, and getting a better idea of their potential impact on your finances, you can make a more informed decision when selecting your car loan. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Car loan ratings by interest rate</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p><span>One of the simplest and most straightforward methods of rating different car loan offers is to compare their interest rates. The lower the interest rate, the less extra money you&rsquo;ll need to pay back to the lender on top of your car loan&rsquo;s principal. </span></p>\n<p><span>Many  come with fixed interest rates, where you pay the same amount of interest with each repayment for the full term of the car loan. Fixed rate  can help to keep your repayments consistent and your budgeting simple. However, if you have a fixed interest rate, you won&rsquo;t enjoy any savings if your lender cuts its interest rates. </span></p>\n<p><span>Variable interest rates are also available for certain . If you choose a variable rate car loan, your lender may raise or lower the interest it charges from month to month, based on the current economy. While this could lower your repayments if rates are cut, it could also mean paying more if rates rise, which can make preparing a budget more challenging. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Rating secured and unsecured </span></h3>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s worth considering whether you&rsquo;d prefer a secured or unsecured car loan, as this can affect your interest rate. </span></p>\n<p><span>Many  are secured loans, where the money you borrow is guaranteed against the value of the car you&rsquo;re buying. This can help to reduce the lender&rsquo;s risk, and therefore allow you to enjoy a more affordable interest rate. However, with some lenders, these loans may not be available for used cars over a certain age, where the vehicle&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t likely to be enough to guarantee the loan over the full term.</span></p>\n<p><span>On the other hand, unsecured  don&rsquo;t require the borrower to provide an asset as security, making them flexible enough to purchase a wider variety of vehicles. However, because of the greater risk they represent to lenders, unsecured  are more likely to have higher interest rates than their secured counterparts.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Rating  for new or used cars</span></h3>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re rating the available , it&rsquo;s important to consider whether you&rsquo;re planning to buy a new or used car. </span></p>\n<p><span>While it&rsquo;s no secret that new cars tend to be more expensive than used cars, new cars can often also offer significant value for money. New cars may integrate new technologies that can help to provide longer-lasting performance and retain the vehicle&rsquo;s value for longer, which can be important when rating your choice of secured .</span></p>\n<p><span>Used cars tend to be more affordable than new cars, but that&rsquo;s not their only appeal. Their value also tends to depreciate more slowly than new cars, allowing you to enjoy greater value from your car loan, and a well-maintained used car can also provide reliable performance. However, for used cars beyond a certain age, you may have trouble applying for a secured car loan with some lenders, who may not feel confident that these vehicles will retain sufficient value to guarantee the loan. In these cases, you may need to pay a higher interest rate for an unsecured car loan.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Rating  by fees and charges</span></h3>\n<p><span>Many lenders charge fees as well as interest on their , which can make a big difference to your household budget. A car loan with a low interest rate and high fees and charges could ultimately turn out to be more expensive in total than a car loan with a higher interest rate and lower fees. </span></p>\n<p><span>To work out the total cost of different car loan offers, you could add up each loan&rsquo;s upfront and ongoing fees and combine them with the estimated interest payments, but it might be simpler just to look at each car loan&rsquo;s Comparison Rate instead. The comparison rate expresses the approximate combined total of a car loan&rsquo;s advertised interest rate and its standard fees and charges, allowing you to quickly and easily get a better idea of how much a car loan is likely to set you back.</span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind that Comparison Rates are best used as general guidelines only when you&rsquo;re looking at . Some lenders charge nonstandard fees for some of their car loan features, which can make these loans more expensive than what their Comparison Rate indicates. On the other hand, some lenders offer extra features with their , which can provide additional value beyond what&rsquo;s indicated by the comparison rate, depending on your financial situation.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Car loan ratings by lender</span></h3>\n<p><span>A wide variety of different lenders have  available, ranging from the big banks to non-bank lenders such as credit unions and building societies. There are benefits and drawbacks to borrowing with different types of lenders, which can affect how you rate different car loan choices.</span></p>\n<p><span>Banks are popular lenders, capable of offering a variety of financial products along with their . Plus, they can often offer a variety of ways to access information about your car loan, from phone and internet banking to dropping into your local branch. However, banks are more likely to have fixed lending criteria for their , which can make it more difficult for some borrowers to successfully apply for a car loan from a bank.</span></p>\n<p><span>Non-bank lenders are more likely to offer  with competitive interest rates and flexible lending terms, which can make them appealing to a wide variety of borrowers. However, these lenders may not be able to offer the same range of features and benefits with their  as those offered by certain banks. And if you take your car loan out from an online-only lender, you won&rsquo;t have the option to visit a local branch or shopfront to discuss your car loan in person. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Car loan ratings by flexibility</span></h3>\n<p><span>Depending on your financial situation, you may rate  that offer greater repayment flexibility more highly than those with fixed repayment schedules. While keeping car loan repayments consistent can help you to manage your budgeting, having additional options available for paying off your car loan can also prove valuable in the right circumstances. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders allow you to make extra repayments onto your car loan, on top of the scheduled repayments. The more of your car loan&rsquo;s principal you pay off, the closer you&rsquo;ll come to exiting the loan early, reducing the amount of total interest you&rsquo;ll need to pay, and ultimately saving you money. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>If you do plan to plan to pay off your car loan ahead of its scheduled term, keep in mind that some lenders charge early exit fees to make up for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on. Make sure that paying off your car early doesn&rsquo;t accidentally cost you more than you expected! </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Another flexible option to keep an eye out for when rating different car loan offers is a Redraw Facility. If you make extra repayments onto your car loan, a redraw facility will allow you to withdraw any surplus balance in excess of your scheduled repayment total. This can come in handy in case of emergencies when you&rsquo;ve already paid you&rsquo;re available money onto your car loan &ndash; just use the redraw facility to withdraw what you need, subject to the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Checking your car&rsquo;s history</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p><span>Regardless of the car loan you choose, it&rsquo;s important to organise a Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) report when purchasing a car. This report, formerly known as a REVS check, looks at the financial history of your vehicle and confirms whether or not it&rsquo;s being sold with a financial encumbrance (money still owing on it from a previous owner). You can organise one of these reports for yourself, and some lenders can save you time and hassle by organising a report for you as part of your car loan, though some lenders charge a fee for this service.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Car loan ratings at RateCity</span></h3>\n<p><span>Depending on the type of car loan you&rsquo;re looking for, you may rate different car loan deals more highly based on different criteria, ranging from  offering interest and comparison rates to help you save money, to  with flexible features and options for managing your finances. </span></p>\n<p><span>Whatever your budget, RateCity puts a wide variety of a  from different lenders all in the one place, allowing you to rate and compare offers however you choose. By rating the available  by the most useful criteria, you&rsquo;ll be able to narrow down your choice of car loan providers until you can make an informed decision about which lender you&rsquo;ll choose when you buy your new or used car. </span></p>",,20,3,8,18,71210,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,7128.4,40.0

When you take out an initial car loan, there will normally be certain conditions in place from your lender. You'll be paying the loan back at an agreed interest rate, variable or fixed depending on the circumstances, but there may be penalties if you finish the loan early by refinancing. Most people who are considering refinancing are looking at maximising their savings by getting the benefits of an interest rate lower than their original loan. You should research online and make comparisons between the refinancing options you might be offered to get the best from any <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/ratings"">refinancing </a></span>.</p>\n<h3>How do refinancing  work?</h3>\n<p>Refinancing a car loan simply means that you switch to a different lender. You could be offered a lower interest rate and lower, or even no fees, as well as easier payment options that could mean paying your loan off sooner. If you get your car refinancing right, you could be in line to save many hundreds of dollars, or thousands depending on how much you have previously borrowed. It&rsquo;s not a difficult process and it&rsquo;s one you can undertake yourself, provided you do the leg work to assess as many options as you can, comparing them against each other and your current loan. If you'd prefer to use a professional, especially if your time is at a premium, a finance broker could help pave the way.</p>\n<h3>Why do people use refinancing ?</h3>\n<p>The main reason for using these loans is to save money, and it could be a significant amount with the right deal. There are three major benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced repayments: </strong>You may be offered better interest rates and fees by lenders when you're exploring your refinancing options.</li>\n<li><strong>Managing a balloon payment: </strong>If you have finance with a dealer, you'll probably have a balloon payment that needs to be covered, which is a large sum at the end of the loan term that will have meant you were probably paying lower instalments than you otherwise would have. Refinancing may allow you to pay back the balloon payment over a longer period if you don't have the lump sum immediately available.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessing a better lender: </strong>Lenders vary in what they will offer you and are always looking for new business. You could find discounts offered on other products if you take out a car loan, and enjoy better customer service or other add-ons that your former lender may not have made available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the main features?</h3>\n<p>Look for lower interest rates and any other additional sweeteners that would be useful to your circumstances. It's a personal loan, so check the terms relating to repayment, the loan term and any hidden charges or fees.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of refinancing ?</h3>\n<p>You have the potential to save a lot of money by refinancing if you get the right deal, but compare the deal you're currently on with a new one to make sure you really are saving money.</p>",,1600,260,989,1143,26892,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,3299.0,49.0

Just like personal loans,  come with a variety of options available to suit different financial situations, with secured  being among the most popular, due to the simplicity and stability of their arrangements.</span></p>\n<p><span>Learn more about secured  at RateCity, and compare what the different lenders are offering to see which deal will be the best for you.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What is a secured car loan?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>A secured loan is an arrangement where the money you borrow from a lender is guaranteed against the value of an asset. If you don&rsquo;t pay the lender back, they seize your asset to cover their losses. Because this arrangement reduces the financial risk to the lender, secured loans tend to have lower interest rates on average than comparable unsecured loans. </span></p>\n<p><span>While the security for a personal loan could be a piece of property or a similarly valuable asset,  are typically secured against the value of the car that&rsquo;s being purchased. That way, if a borrower is unable to make their monthly repayments and defaults on their loan, the lender will simply repossess and sell the car to get its money back. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What are the benefits of a secured car loan?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>To start with, because a secured car loan is guaranteed against the value of your car, lenders don&rsquo;t have to stress as much about losing money in the event of a default, so they often charge lower interest rates for secured  than they would for similar unsecured .</span></p>\n<p><span>Secured  can also be valid financial options for borrowers with less stable finances (e.g. contracting or self-employed) or a poor credit history, as the security of the car as collateral mitigates a degree of the potential lender risk</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What are the risks with a secured car loan?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Nobody wants to default on any type of loan &ndash; it&rsquo;s bad news for your finances, and for your credit history &ndash; but if you default on a secured car loan, you&rsquo;ll also lose your car! While paying the extra interest of an unsecured loan is typically a more expensive option from month to month, you won&rsquo;t automatically end up a pedestrian if you run into financial trouble. </span></p>\n<p><span>Also, because these loans are secured against the value of the car you&rsquo;re purchasing, there are sometimes limitations as to what kind of cars you can buy with one. For example, some lenders will only offer secured  for brand new cars, or used cars under a certain age. Others may refuse to offer secured loans for certain car models. These restrictions are to help make sure that if the lender is forced to repossess and sell the car, they can be confident they&rsquo;ll make enough money to cover their costs. </span></p>\n<p><span>Also, it&rsquo;s worth noting that some secured  may only allow you to borrow up to the value of the car itself. This means you may need to pay separately for any extra vehicle expenses, such as rego and insurance. However, some lenders will allow you to borrow more than your car&rsquo;s value with a secured car loan to cover these expenses &ndash; check the available offers for details. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How to compare secured </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>One of the simplest ways to start narrowing down your secured car loan options is to compare the interest rates being charged by different lenders. The higher the rates, the more you&rsquo;ll have to repay on your loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>But to get a more complete idea of just how much a secured car loan may end up costing you over its lifetime, it&rsquo;s also worth checking out its Comparison Rate, which combines the loan&rsquo;s interest rate with its standard fees and charges. While this does give you a good guideline of the comparative costs of different secured , remember that the comparison rate doesn&rsquo;t include every extra cost of a loan, nor does it take into account any extra features and benefits that could influence your decision. It&rsquo;s usually worth digging a little deeper and doing some extra research rather than relying on comparison rates alone. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Fixed vs variable interest rates</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Because secured  are all about security (hence the name), they are commonly offered with a fixed interest rate. By agreeing in advance to pay a set amount of interest per month with your repayments over a set period of time, the lender can be confident they&rsquo;ll get their money back, and you can be confident when preparing your budget, as you&rsquo;ll know exactly how much you&rsquo;ll be paying towards your car loan each month. </span></p>\n<p><span>While secured  with fixed interest rates are quite simple to manage, and help to ensure regular progress towards paying off your loan, locking in a payment plan in advance often means losing some flexibility and options around how you can repay your loan &ndash; you may be required to stick to the agreed payment plan, even if your financial circumstances change further down the line.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some secured  are available with variable interest rates, where the lender will adjust the amount of interest they charge from month to month. This can mean you&rsquo;ll save some money if your lender passes on a rate cut, however you may find yourself out of pocket in the event of a rate rise, which can make variable rate  a little trickier to budget for. </span></p>\n<p><span>That said, variable rate loans are more likely to offer you greater flexibility around your repayments, allowing you to put extra onto your car loan and get ahead when your finances are strong.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Early exit/extra repayment penalties</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Imagine you find yourself with a bit of extra money available &ndash; maybe you have a tax refund to spend, or a rate cut leaves you with a surplus available in your personal budget. You may want to put this extra money onto your car loan, bringing you one step closer to exiting your car loan early, and reducing the total amount of interest you pay over the loan&rsquo;s lifetime. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, paying off your secured car loan early can sometimes be more expensive than you expect. Some lenders charge fees for making extra car loan repayments or for exiting a loan early, to make up for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on. These penalty charges tend to be more common for fixed rate  with set payment plans. Variable rate  are often more flexible in their repayment arrangements, though they sometimes also charge early exit fees. Be sure to check your loan&rsquo;s terms and conditions if you hope to pay your car off early.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Redraw Facility</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>The ability to easily make extra payments on a car loan is pretty handy, but so is being able to withdraw some of this cash if you run into a tight financial spot. A Redraw Facility on your secured car loan will allow you to do exactly that, making any extra money you&rsquo;ve put on your car loan available in case of emergency. This added flexibility can come in very handy, though you should double-check your lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions for any restrictions around how you can use their redraw facility. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Encumbrance/REVS Check Fee</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>It usually pays to confirm a car&rsquo;s financial history before agreeing to a purchase, just in case the vehicle still has money owing on it, AKA a financial encumbrance. You can confirm a car&rsquo;s history with a report from the Australian Government&rsquo;s Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR), formerly known as REVS. Some lenders can organise this check for you as part of their service, though this may sometimes cost you an extra fee. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>100% Loans</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>You don&rsquo;t have to miss out on the car you want if you can&rsquo;t get the cash together for a car loan deposit. Some lenders offer high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) loans where you pay a smaller deposit and borrow more. Other lenders offer 100% , where you pay no deposit and instead borrow the full value of the car. Remember that if you choose a secured car loan with one of these options, you&rsquo;ll likely pay a higher interest rate to make up for the increased risk to the lender. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare more secured </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Once you know exactly what you want from a secured car loan, you can start narrowing down your selection from the offers found on RateCity. By comparing a wide variety of secured car loan deals in one place, you can look at offers from different lenders side by side, and quickly work out which one will best match your finance requirements.

Having a reliable car becomes essential to get to work, do the school run, pick up the groceries from the supermarket and ferry the kids and yourself from place to place. The good news is that there&rsquo;s no need to add ""getting car finance"" to your hoop collection. Here are some of the options you can consider if you&rsquo;re searching for a car loan and are worried about your single parent status:</p>\n<h4><strong>How do  for single parents work?</strong></h4>\n<p>If you depend on a single income, perhaps from a part time job, and also look after the family, it can be worrying when you realise you do not meet the financial requirements that some lenders set. You may be surprised and pleased to learn that several different types of  for single parents are available from&nbsp;a number of lenders.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are already receiving&nbsp;government funds from Centrelink and have a regular income, you may be eligible for a loan. You may be able to apply for no-interest loans if you are borrowing for goods or services deemed essential. With a regular income, you may be in a position to choose a short term or a secured loan to purchase a car. There are also charitable organisations that partner with banks to provide finance for single parents and families on low incomes for a range of purposes.</p>\n<h4><strong>What are the features?</strong></h4>\n<p>Interest rates may be fixed or variable, and some lenders offer flexible repayments, which means you may be able to make extra payments when this suits and repay your loan early without incurring penalties. Loan terms refer to the length of time you will have to repay the sum you have borrowed. These vary enormously and it&rsquo;s usually possible for you to negotiate terms with your lender that suit your income level and cash flow. Often terms for variable loans are slightly longer than those for fixed rate loans.</p>\n<p>At some point there are fees payable for arranging a loan, however some lenders charge more than others. You may be charged an application fee upfront, and then nothing further. Conversely, your loan may be awarded without paying a fee, but there may be monthly accounting charges to pay. Sometimes lenders offer additional features, such as a redraw facility or an extended warranty.</p>\n<h4><strong>What are the pros and cons of  for single parents?</strong></h4>\n<p>Getting help when you need it to purchase a car is obviously beneficial for you and your family. With the right deal, you can make the most of car ownership at an affordable price.</p>\n<p>Be vigilant and aware, as sometimes lenders that are less than reputable will hike up fees and charges so much you will have difficulty meeting your financial commitments. Always check your eligibility with a potential lender before making a car loan application.</p>",,5,67,314,367,17088,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1844.9500000000003,69.0

In this major city, there are deals offered by established lenders as well as newer, online-only financiers. All of this is advantageous if you&rsquo;re looking for a good value loan for your next, or first, car.</p>\n<p>Commercially, Sydney is a favourite with multinationals, and the finance and insurance services industry is very buoyant, which works in your favour.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>How do  in Sydney work?</h3>\n<p>With a competitive marketplace, you can be assured that interest rates on loans are kept low, making it easier to find a bargain. With a pre-approved loan, you can secure your finance before making a purchase and there are plenty of lenders willing to oblige. If you plan to buy a new car, you may well benefit from lower interest rates than those purchasing used vehicles.</p>\n<p>The same applies if you are willing to secure your loan on your car or a property, for example your home. Often, secured loans are cheaper than unsecured ones. In any case, your credit history will be checked when applying for a <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/car-loans/best"">Sydney car loan.</a></span></p>\n<h3>What are the main features of  in Sydney?</h3>\n<p>Loans differ according to the criteria you are seeking and the facilities offered by the lender. These focus on the amount you want to borrow, the type of interest rate, your credit status and any extra features you may require.</p>\n<p>Interest rates may be fixed or variable. Features may include balloon arrangements, flexible repayments and low cost loans reflecting individual circumstances, such as whether you are a single parent or a pensioner, for example.</p>\n<p>A balloon payment system allows you to pay smaller regular amounts on the basis that a much larger payment falls due at the end of the loan period. In certain circumstances, you can decide to refinance your vehicle instead of repaying the final instalment in full.</p>\n<p>A flexible payment system permits you to make more than the agreed minimum payment from time to time. This means you might be able to repay your loan early, however, as some lenders place restrictions on how often you can do this, or charge additional fees, you should check these details in advance.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons?</h3>\n<p>A good deal on your personal finance borrowings will help you get the vehicle you want promptly, and at a fair price. This is one reason why when choosing your loan provider you should always check the comparison rate displayed alongside the advertised rate. Any extra fees or charges are included in the comparison rate so you will be able to get a clear picture of the differences between lenders.</p>\n<p>Read your car loan agreement carefully before making a commitment. This is to prevent damage to your credit history in case you discover you cannot manage repayments and ultimately default on your loan.</p>",,260,0,0,1,101,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,36.25,293.0

If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to finance your car purchase without jumping through too many hoops, you may find an Unsecured Car Loan worth considering.</span></p>\n<p><span>At RateCity, not only can you compare the differences between secured and unsecured , but you can also learn more about the benefits and drawbacks of the different options, to better determine which car loan is the right match for your financial situation.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Benefits of an unsecured car loan</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Many of Australia&rsquo;s  are Secured Loans, where the money you borrow is guaranteed against the value of your car purchase. Secured  offer many benefits, such as&nbsp; lower average interest rates, thanks to the reduced risk they represent to lenders. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, if you take out a secured car loan, you may lose your car if you don&rsquo;t meet your loan repayments. You may only be able to use a secured loan to buy particular car models, or cars under a certain age. And because the money you borrow will need to be secured against the car&rsquo;s value, your loan may not cover other expenses such as car insurance and registration, which will need to be paid for separately. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Unsecured , on the other hand, don&rsquo;t need to be secured against the value of an asset, so you&rsquo;re more likely to be able to buy cars of different models and ages. If you rely on your car and don&rsquo;t want to risk having it repossessed, an unsecured car loan will let you retain access to your wheels, even if the worst should happen.&nbsp; Also, the amount you borrow in an unsecured car loan doesn&rsquo;t have to be strictly limited by your car&rsquo;s value, so you may be able to borrow some extra money to pay for insurance, rego and other car-related expenses. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Drawbacks of an unsecured car loan</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s important to always acknowledge the risks involved with any car loan or other personal loan. Because by definition unsecured  don&rsquo;t have any security, lenders see them as higher risks, and usually charge correspondingly higher interest rates, increasing your monthly repayments.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, the more you borrow with an unsecured car loan, the more you&rsquo;ll have to pay back, which in turn means paying more interest. So if you use an unsecured car loan to not only pay for a car, but its insurance and rego too, the ongoing interest costs on this higher borrowed sum can quickly start to add up. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Fixed vs variable rate </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you like the look of an unsecured car loan, the next question to ask is whether it comes with a fixed or variable interest rate. Much like secured and unsecured , these options each have their own benefits and drawbacks. </span></p>\n<p><span>Choosing a car loan with a fixed interest rate means agreeing to pay a set amount of interest as part of your loan repayments every month. While this helps to keep your monthly repayments stable, and your household budget nice and simple, it also means you won&rsquo;t get to save money if your lender cuts its interest rates. </span></p>\n<p><span>A variable rate car loan means the amount of interest you&rsquo;ll pay may change from month to month, potentially lowering your repayments if there&rsquo;s a rate cut, saving you some money. On the other hand, if your lender raises its interest rates, your monthly repayments would increase, which could leave you out of pocket if your household budget isn&rsquo;t ready.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What is a Comparison Rate?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Did you know that the unsecured car loan with the lowest advertised interest rate may not actually be the cheapest option for you? A low-interest car loan with high ongoing fees and charges could end up costing you more in total than opting for a higher-interest car loan with lower ongoing fees and charges. </span></p>\n<p><span>A car loan&rsquo;s Comparison Rate offers a simpler way to work out approximately how much it may end up costing you. Expressed as a percentage, this figure combines the loan&rsquo;s advertised interest rate with its standard fees and charges. Comparison rates can be used to help you narrow down your potential car loan choices by cost.</span></p>\n<p><span>Keep in mind that even a car loan&rsquo;s comparison rate may not take its every cost into account &ndash; some nonstandard charges and expenses could remain separate to the figure. Also, you should investigate the other features and benefits offered by each car loan option before making a decision, as these aren&rsquo;t factored into the comparison rate either. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Does paying off a car loan early cost you extra?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>While buying a car with the help of a car loan is a pretty great feeling, owning your car outright feels even better. With this in mind, you may be tempted to pay extra money into your car loan when the opportunity arises, such as when you receive a tax refund, a bonus, an inheritance, or that one-in-a-million lottery win we&rsquo;re all hoping for. By making extra repayments and getting your car loan paid off ahead of time, you&rsquo;ll save money by reducing the total interest you pay over the lifetime of your loan.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, some lenders charge fees for making extra repayments or exiting a loan early, to make up for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on. These fees tend to be more common with fixed rate  that have set repayment plans, though they are sometimes also found in variable rate . If you&rsquo;re hoping to pay off your car loan ahead of schedule, make sure you won&rsquo;t find yourself paying more than you expected for the privilege.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Can you withdraw money from your car loan?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re looking at unsecured  because you like the sound of the flexibility they offer, then you may also want to find out which  include the option of a redraw facility. If you make extra repayments and get ahead on one of these loans, you&rsquo;ll be able to use the redraw facility to withdraw these surplus funds when required, subject to the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span>So if you&rsquo;ve ever worried that making extra repayments onto a car loan could leave you unable to access your spare cash in case of emergency, a redraw facility can help you keep your funds accessible when required, while still helping to bring you closer to a fully paid-off car loan. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What if you don&rsquo;t have a deposit?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>While unsecured  don&rsquo;t require you to use your car as collateral to guarantee your loan, you may still need to pay a deposit to provide some security to your lender. However, if the state of your savings means you can&rsquo;t currently afford a full deposit on the car you want, there may still be options available to you. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders offer  with a high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), where you borrow a greater percentage of your car&rsquo;s value and pay a smaller up-front deposit. Some lenders also offer 100% loans, also known as no-deposit loans, where you borrow the full amount from the lender. Because these loan types represent greater financial risks to lenders, they tend to come with relatively high interest rates, so keep this in mind when working out your finances. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Checking your car&rsquo;s history</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;ve done a bit of research on available  and worked out which options you prefer, it&rsquo;s often worth also doing a bit of research on the car you intend to buy, and its financial history. You don&rsquo;t want to complete the paperwork only discover that the car has money still owing on it from a previous owner!</span></p>\n<p><span>To avoid being surprised by a financial encumbrance when buying a used car, it&rsquo;s worth organising a Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) report, previously known as a REVS check. You can organise one of these reports for yourself, though some lenders will be able to take care of this for you while they&rsquo;re putting together your car loan, though some lenders will charge an extra fee for the service. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare unsecured </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>You can find and compare a variety of car loan options at RateCity, including unsecured . By looking at the advertised interest and comparison rates, as well as their other features and benefits, you can narrow down your options before making your final decision. </span></p>",,140,63,221,214,12071,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1317.8500000000001,87.0

Unlike a credit card, there isn&rsquo;t usually an easy way to borrow more money on a personal loan, so as long as you&rsquo;re careful, you can pay off your loan in a timely manner and avoid becoming trapped in debt.</span></p>\n<p><span>Just like other personal loans, there are a multitude of car loan options available from a variety of lenders to suit all financial situations. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Used  vs New </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>In most cases, the biggest difference between a loan for a used car and a loan for a new car is the rate of interest you&rsquo;ll be paying &ndash; you&rsquo;ll likely pay more in interest for a used car loan than a new car loan.</span></p>\n<p><span>The reason for these higher rates is that most lenders consider used cars to be higher financial risks than new cars. Used cars have typically experienced more wear and tear than new cars, making them less likely to last for the lifetime of the loan. Thus, lenders usually charge extra interest for used  compared to similar new , to help insulate themselves from this extra risk.</span></p>\n<p><span>So what&rsquo;s the biggest benefit of a used car loan? Well, because used cars usually cost less to buy than similar new cars, you shouldn&rsquo;t need to borrow quite as much money to afford a used set of wheels. A smaller car loan should therefore mean smaller monthly repayments, or you could make a higher (but still affordable) repayment per month over a shorter time period and get your car loan paid off a bit faster, while limiting the total interest you&rsquo;ll pay over the lifetime of the loan. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What counts as a &ldquo;used&rdquo; car?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Different lenders use different criteria to determine whether a car counts as New or Used, and to in turn estimate its level of risk. For example, some lenders count any car less than 2 years old as New, and any older car as Used. </span></p>\n<p><span>Also keep in mind that some lenders will only offer loans on cars up to a certain age, such as 5 years, and consider cars older than this too risky to safely finance. Check the history of the used car you&rsquo;re looking at buying to determine which  you qualify for. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How to compare used </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Firstly, you should make sure you&rsquo;re comparing apples with apples&hellip; or at least used  with other used  offering similar terms. Work out how much you want to borrow and how much time you&rsquo;d like to repay the loan, then compare the estimated monthly repayments to your budget to get a general idea of what you can afford. </span></p>\n<p><span>A used car loan&rsquo;s monthly repayments are affected by its interest rate &ndash; the higher the rate, the higher the repayments. Remember that if you select a variable rate used car loan, the advertised interest rate may rise or fall from month to month as the lender passes on rate rises and cuts, so it&rsquo;s often worth budgeting a bit of money in reserve just in case of a surprise rate hike. Selecting a used car loan with a fixed interest rate will keep your repayments stable and consistent every month, but you won&rsquo;t enjoy savings from interest rates cuts, and you may also lose some flexibility around how you can repay your loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>As well as paying interest on your used car loan, you&rsquo;ll likely also have to pay fees and charges, such as application fees and ongoing fees. Rather than going through every loan and adding up these extra costs individually, you can instead look at the loan&rsquo;s Comparison Rate, which is a percentage that bundles a loan&rsquo;s advertised interest rate with its standard fees and charges. This can give you a more accurate guideline of how much different  will ultimately cost you, but remember that even the comparison rate doesn&rsquo;t include every cost associated with a loan, nor does it account for any extra features and benefits that may affect your car loan decision. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Can you secure your used car loan?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Many  are Secured Loans, where the money you borrow is secured against the value of an asset, typically the car you&rsquo;re buying. If you default on your repayments, the lender recovers its loss by repossessing your car. Because lenders tend to consider secured loans to be less risky, you can often get a more affordable interest rate by securing your car loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re looking for a secured loan on a used car, keep in mind that some lenders will only offer secured loans for particular vehicle models, or for cars that are under a certain age. If the car you&rsquo;re buying doesn&rsquo;t qualify, you might still be able to secure your car loan with some other asset, such as property, or you could opt for an Unsecured Car Loan instead. These loans don&rsquo;t require security, though they typically have higher interest rates to make up for the added risk to the lender.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Can you make extra repayments/exit the loan early?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you win the lottery, or more likely, get a bonus from work or a refund from the tax office, it&rsquo;s often worth thinking about putting this extra money onto your car loan. The faster you can pay off your car loan, the sooner you can exit the loan, and the less total interest you&rsquo;ll have to pay over its lifetime. Sounds like a win all-round, right?</span></p>\n<p><span>But before you stick all of your spare cash onto your car loan, check whether your lender charges fees for making extra payments or exiting from the loan early, to make up for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on. These fees are more commonly found on fixed-rate , but may be encountered with some variable rate loans too. </span></p>\n<p><span>If your car loan allows you to make extra repayments, look into whether it also features a redraw facility. If you&rsquo;re ahead in your car loan, but find yourself running into financial trouble, you can use the redraw facility to take out any extra money you&rsquo;ve paid onto your loan, for some added financial flexibility. It&rsquo;s also worth checking whether your lender has any restrictions on how you use your redraw facility.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>No deposit?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Even a borrower with reliable income and good credit may find themselves lacking the deposit required to take out certain . In these cases, certain lenders offer used  with a high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) that only require a small deposit, or even 100% loans that require no deposit. Be mindful that these loans usually have higher interest rates, due to the increased risk to the lender. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Encumbrance/REVS Check Fee</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re buying a used car, it&rsquo;s important to check the vehicle&rsquo;s financial history to confirm that it isn&rsquo;t hiding any secrets, such as money still owing on a car loan, AKA a financial encumbrance. You can get a report from the Australian Government&rsquo;s Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR), previously known as REVS, to find out whether there&rsquo;s anything you should know about a used car before you take home the keys. </span></p>\n<p><span>While you can organise a PPSR report/REVS check yourself, some lenders can take care of this hassle for you when organising your used car loan, though some lenders charge a fee for this service. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare used </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;ve got a good idea of what you want from your used car loan it&rsquo;s time to compare the available offers. </span></p>\n<p><span>RateCity puts a variety of loans from a range of lenders all in one place, so you can compare interest rates, fees and other features, and make a more informed decision. Then it&rsquo;s just a matter of contacting a lender and sorting out the details, and you can get your used car on the road!</span></p>",,720,935,2554,2333,170855,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,18358.05,26.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the  that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h3><span>Variable Rate </span></h3>\n<p><span>One of the biggest benefits of owning a car is the flexibility it adds to your everyday life. Want to pop down to the shops? Just a drive away. Need to move something from A to B? Put it in the car. Late for an urgent appointment? You COULD look at public transport schedules and lace up your walking shoes&hellip; or you could just jump behind the wheel instead. </span></p>\n<p><span>If flexibility is important to you, then a car loan with a variable interest rate may also prove appealing. Depending on your lender and financial situation, a variable rate car loan may allow you to save some money on your monthly repayments, or even to pay off your car loan early and hit the road in your very own car that much sooner. </span></p>\n<h3><span>The basics of car loan interest rates</span></h3>\n<p><span>When you borrow money to buy a new or used car, you&rsquo;ll have to pay your lender a certain amount of interest in addition to the value of the car. </span></p>\n<p><span>Many lenders offer  with fixed interest rates, where the amount of interest that&rsquo;s charged with your repayments remains the same from month to month. This keeps your repayments consistent for the full term of your loan, helping to ensure that your budget remains simple.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, some lenders offer  with variable interest rates, where your monthly repayments may rise or fall when the lender raises or lowers its interest rates to suit the prevailing economic conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span>Whether you&rsquo;re looking at variable or fixed interest rates for your car loan, you&rsquo;ll also have to pay any fees the lender charges. A low-interest car loan with high fees and charges could ultimately cost you more in total than a higher-interest car loan with lower fees and charges.</span></p>\n<p><span>To make comparing the total cost of different  a bit simpler, take a look at their Comparison Rates. These figures combine each loan&rsquo;s advertised interest rate with its standard fees and charges, giving you a more accurate guideline for seeing how different  stack up alongside one another. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s usually worth taking a closer look at the available car loan options &ndash; some lenders may offer additional features that could add extra value and influence your decision. Just remember that some  have nonstandard fees, charges and other costs that aren&rsquo;t included in their comparison rates. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Variable Rate Car Loan Benefits</span></h3>\n<p><span>One of the biggest potential benefits of choosing a variable rate car loan is that you may find yourself paying less interest than you expected. While you may start paying off your car loan at the advertised rate, if your lender cuts its interest rates, your monthly repayments will drop accordingly. </span></p>\n<p><span>The other major benefit of variable rate  is that they often offer greater flexibility around your repayments than similar fixed rate , which are more likely to lock you into a pre-set repayment plan, with penalty fees for making extra repayments or for exiting the loan early.</span></p>\n<p><span>With a variable rate car loan, if&nbsp;interest rates are cut, you may choose to put the money you save on repayments to good use somewhere else, though one possible option is to add these extra savings onto your car loan and get ahead of your repayment schedule. This can help to bring you closer to fully paying off your car loan ahead of schedule, reducing your total number of repayments, and reducing the total interest you&rsquo;ll pay over your loan&rsquo;s lifetime. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Variable Rate Car Loan drawbacks</span></h3>\n<p><span>Because there&rsquo;s no such thing as a crystal ball that makes foolproof economic forecasts, when you take out a variable rate car loan, you run the risk that interest rates may rise during its term. The longer the term of your car loan, the greater the likelihood of eventually experiencing a rate rise. An extended period of rising rates could leave you paying significantly more for your car loan than what you initially budgeted for, putting you at greater risk of financial stress. </span></p>\n<p><span>Also, it&rsquo;s worth checking the terms and conditions of your variable rate car loan before you start thinking about exiting the loan early. While many variable rate  offer more flexible repayment terms than their fixed rate counterparts, some lenders charge fees for making an early exit from their loans. Make sure that paying off your car loan early won&rsquo;t accidentally cost you more than you expected. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Redraw Facility</span></h3>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re comparing your variable rate car loan options, a Redraw Facility is one feature that&rsquo;s often worth keeping your eye out for. A redraw facility allows you to withdraw any extra money you pay onto your car loan in excess of the repayment schedule, subject to your lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. This can help you to confidently make extra repayments and get ahead on your car loan, since if an emergency comes up and your finances get a bit tight, you&rsquo;ll have the option to unlock your extra car loan repayments and put them back into your pocket again. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Secured and Unsecured </span></h3>\n<p><span>One way to help keep your car loan&rsquo;s variable interest rates on the low side is to opt for a Secured Car Loan. By using the value of the car you&rsquo;re buying as collateral to guarantee your loan, you can lessen your lender&rsquo;s financial risk &ndash; if you default on your car loan repayments, the lender will be able to repossess and sell your car to make their money back. This added security for the lender means they&rsquo;re more likely to offer you lower interest rates. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, to qualify for a secured car loan with certain lenders, you may need to be buying a car of a particular make and model, or one that&rsquo;s under a certain age, to better guarantee its value. And of course, there&rsquo;s the risk that if you don&rsquo;t make your repayments, you could end up losing the car. </span></p>\n<p><span>If this doesn&rsquo;t appeal to you, there is the option of an Unsecured Car Loan, which doesn&rsquo;t require the same kind of security, and thus has fewer restrictions around what vehicles it can be used to buy. However, these loans tend to have higher average interest rates to better make up for the increased financial risk to their lenders. </span></p>\n<h3><span>100% </span></h3>\n<p><span>While many variable rate  offer increased flexibility compared to some fixed rate , you&rsquo;re likely to still need to pay a deposit if you want to enjoy the lowest possible interest rates, as a deposit helps to financially secure your loan and reduce the lender&rsquo;s risk. </span></p>\n<p><span>But even if you don&rsquo;t have enough money saved up to afford a full deposit on the car you want, you may still be able to take out a car loan to buy it. Some lenders offer  with a higher Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), where you make a smaller up-front deposit and borrow a greater percentage of the car&rsquo;s value. Other lenders offer 100% loans, where you borrow the full value of the car and pay no deposit. </span></p>\n<p><span>These car loan options are more likely to charge higher interest rates to make up for the increased lender risk, so consider whether it would be more affordable to make these higher monthly repayments, or to save up for that initial deposit.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Checking your car&rsquo;s financial history</span></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re buying a car that&rsquo;s been owned before, it&rsquo;s usually worth checking out whether it still has money owing on it from a previous owner, a.k.a&nbsp;a financial encumbrance. To check this, you can organise a Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) report, previously known as a REVS check. It&rsquo;s possible to organise one of these reports for yourself, however your lender may be able to save you some time and effort by organising one for you, though some lenders charge a fee for this service. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Compare Variable Rate </span></h3>\n<p><span>Do you know what you&rsquo;re looking for in a car loan? If flexibility is important to you, variable rate  could sound appealing. At RateCity, you can compare different car loan offers from Australian lenders, and work out which one will best suit your finances, based on its features and benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;re confident in your choice of variable rate car loan, all you need to do is contact the lender to get the ball rolling. Soon you&rsquo;ll be able to drive away in a car of your own, and enjoy the extra flexibility it adds to your lifestyle. </span></p>",,150,37,148,130,6031,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,678.3000000000001,121.0

It&rsquo;s an incentive offered by credit card providers to entice new customers to use their products. </span></p>\n<p><span>There are a range of benefits for opting to ditch your old credit card in favour of a new one. A zero per cent balance transfer deal is one of them because it&rsquo;s also a way to freeze the interest payable on what you owe for a set period of time. </span></p>\n<h3>Who offers balance transfers?</h3>\n<p><span>Balance transfers of zero per cent have become increasingly more popular. As a result, more and more credit providers offer this type of deal. The kind of debt that can be transferred to a credit card using this deal is broadening too. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some financial institutions allow the balance of personal loans to be transferred to their credit card. Balance transfers are available on credit card products, which means you can shop around the various banks, credit unions and non-bank lending institutions to see who has the best deal.</span></p>\n<h3>How does a 0% balance transfer work?</h3>\n<p><span>A zero per cent balance transfer deal works this way. Let&rsquo;s say you owe $11,000 on your current credit card and are paying 20 per cent on the balance. To get on top of your repayments, you apply for a new credit card offering a zero per cent balance transfer. </span></p>\n<p><span>If your application is successful, your $11,000 debt gets transferred to the new credit card (and your old card is paid off). Your new credit card balance of $11,000 will not accrue any interest for the period of time outlined in the deal.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s worth exercising discipline during the zero per cent interest period on your carried balance. Once the interest-free period ends, most credit cards will revert back to the standard interest rate or even higher. </span></p>\n<h3>How do I do a balance transfer?</h3>\n<p><span>Transferring your balance from one credit card to another is a simple process.</span></p>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;ve completed a credit card application &ndash; and it&rsquo;s successful &ndash; your new lender may pay out your old credit card balance without you needing to do anything. It&rsquo;s common practice for credit providers offering this type of deal to manage the pay-out of your old credit card for you. </span></p>\n<h3>Do balance transfers involve fees?</h3>\n<p><span>As with most credit card products, the associated fees and charges are variable. Whether there are fees payable is dependent on the individual financial institution. So it&rsquo;s worth paying attention to the terms and conditions for each zero per cent balance transfer deal you explore. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders charge a &lsquo;balance transfer fee&rsquo; for the amount being carried across to the new credit card. This is usually charged as a percentage of the balance owing. You might also have to pay an annual fee for the type of credit card you choose. </span></p>\n<h3>The pros of 0% balance transfers</h3>\n<p><span>The most obvious benefit of a zero per cent balance transfer is the opportunity to tackle your credit card debt. Not paying interest on the carried balance for anywhere up to 24 months means that repayments could be fixed, making them easy to manage as part of your budget. </span></p>\n<p><span>In addition to a zero per cent balance transfer, many credit cards offer incentives such as reward points, shopping discounts, cash back incentives, insurance discounts and more. As well as being able to easily manage your interest-free repayments, you can also enjoy some fringe benefits.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span>An overarching benefit is that this type of deal provides an incentive to change credit cards. By taking advantage of a balance transfer, you might find the new credit card has a lower interest rate for purchases and cash advances, more interest-free days and a low or no annual fee. </span></p>\n<h3>What are the alternatives to balance transfers?</h3>\n<p><span>The alternative to a balance transfer is another type of loan product or self-imposed austerity measures (if you have the self-control). A balance transfer is literally transferring debt from one credit product to another. Most commonly, it&rsquo;s the transfer of debt between credit cards. </span></p>\n<p><span>If your goal is to abolish credit card debt altogether, you may want to investigate what personal loans suit your situation. A personal loan usually offers a lower interest rate than credit cards, and gives you the choice of fixing the rate for the period of the loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>Or, if you&rsquo;re a home owner, you could explore a redraw option. This would let you &lsquo;borrow&rsquo; from your mortgage to pay out your credit card. As with personal loans, home loan interest rates are generally lower than credit cards, so this could be a more economical solution if it&rsquo;s available to you.</span></p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

If you&rsquo;re an avid traveller or frequent online shopper, you may want to consider a credit card with a 0 per cent currency conversion. Credit cards with 0 per cent currency conversion don&rsquo;t charge you any fees on foreign transactions.</p>\n<p>Credit cards with 0 per cent currency conversion can help you save money if you&rsquo;re using your card overseas or shopping online with an international retailer. Even though you&rsquo;re not paying a currency conversion fee, you&rsquo;re still using a credit card. Before you apply for a credit card, do your research and compare which credit card makes the most sense for you.</p>\n<h3>What is foreign currency conversion?</h3>\n<p>When you travel overseas or buy something using your Australian credit card in another country, the amount you spend gets converted back to Australian dollars. Even if you have a credit card that charges you 0 per cent to convert the currency, the amount you spend will still be converted back to Australian dollars. The exchange rate is usually set daily by the credit card or bank and will vary depending on the type of credit card you use. Generally speaking, banks and credit cards have less favourable interest rates, so check before you make any large purchases.</p>\n<p>Depending on where you travel, you might have the option to pay in either the local currency or in Australian dollars. Although it may seem like good value to pay in Australian Dollars, &lsquo;dynamic currency conversions&rsquo; (DCC) attract a fee which ranges between 3 and 10 per cent, so be sure to check before you sign on the dotted line.</p>\n<h3>What to look for in 0% foreign fee credit cards</h3>\n<p>Credit cards with 0 per cent foreign fees are ideally suited to borrowers who use the card for overseas transactions or shopping online from international stores. At the end of the day, 0 per cent fees on international transactions are features of a credit card, which means that when you&rsquo;re comparing your options, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there are other factors to consider.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to look out for to avoid any surprise charges or out of pocket fees.</p>\n<p><strong>Currency conversion fee</strong></p>\n<p>When you use your credit card overseas, you&rsquo;ll most likely be charged a conversion fee to convert your overseas purchase into the local currency. Opting for a 0 per cent foreign fee credit card means that you don&rsquo;t pay anything to convert the funds from Australian dollars to the local currency. Most credit cards charge an average fee of 3 per cent, so if you&rsquo;re a frequent flyer or shopper, cards that don&rsquo;t charge currency conversions could save you additional costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Overseas ATM withdrawal fees</strong></p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re overseas, using your card to withdraw local currency from an ATM can add between 2 to 4 per cent to the transaction. To avoid any additional fees, opt for a card which doesn&rsquo;t charge any ATM withdrawal surcharges.</p>\n<p>Other charges to look out for are cash advance fees and any additional annual card fees.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, you&rsquo;re probably looking for a credit card that gives you the freedom to travel, but doesn&rsquo;t charge you additional fees for the privilege. As with any credit card application, always make sure that the costs don&rsquo;t outweigh the benefits and that you&rsquo;re borrowing within your means.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

Any remaining amount that hasn't been paid off by the end of the promotional offer will start to collect interest.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that not all transactions on this type of credit card will be eligible for 0 per cent percent interest. For example, your provider might stipulate that cash advances are not included. In this case, any cash transactions made during the promotional period would be subject to the standard interest rate.</p>\n<p>If you're considering a 0 per cent purchase credit card, don&rsquo;t forget that the interest-free period is temporary. Paying off your balance before the end of the promotional period means you don&rsquo;t pay any interest.</p>\n<h3>Pros and cons of 0% purchase credit cards</h3>\n<p>When weighing up whether or not to choose a 0 per cent purchase credit card, consider some of the pros and cons:</p>\n<p><span><strong>Pros</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No interest for a set period &ndash;</strong> The most obvious benefit is that you have the opportunity to make purchases during the introductory period without incurring any interest, provided you pay back the balance before the period ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Good for large purchases &ndash;</strong> If you want to make a sizeable purchase but need some time to pay it off, a 0 per cent purchase credit card can help by allowing you to space out repayments.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Useful for balance transfers &ndash;</strong> Certain providers offer 0 per cent interest on balance transfers for a defined period, giving you a window of time when interest won&rsquo;t accrue on your balance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>Cons</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Benefits are temporary &ndash;</strong> The 0 per cent interest only lasts for the duration of the introductory period. Once it ends, the card will revert to the standard interest rate, which could be high.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Balance transfer fees may apply &ndash;</strong> Even if your provider offers 0 per cent interest on balance transfers, they may still charge you a balance transfer fee.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limitations apply &ndash;</strong> Not all transactions are eligible for 0 per cent interest, and you could be penalised for late payments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Types of 0% purchase credit cards</h3>\n<p>Most 0 per cent purchase credit cards fall into one of the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standard 0 per cent purchases &ndash;</strong> This includes a 0 per cent interest rate on purchases over an introductory period. The interest rate becomes standard after the period ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>0 per cent purchases with balance transfers &ndash;</strong> Includes no interest payable on purchases as well as balance transfers during the promotional period.

From the outside, reward points can seem like you&rsquo;re getting something for free. While there are benefits to cards that offer bonus points, they often attract higher fees and interest rates. Before you decide on a credit card that offers bonus points, it&rsquo;s important to do your research and make sure that the costs don&rsquo;t outweigh the benefits.</p>\n<p>Credit cards that offer over 100,000+ bonus points reward your everyday spending with rewards points. Depending on the type of card, the bonus points could be linked to frequent flyer programs or could be used to redeem cashback, free flights, merchandise or various other lifestyle rewards.</p>\n<h3>How do credit card rewards programs work?</h3>\n<p>There is no one-size-fits-all credit card that offers over 100,000+ bonus points. Depending on the lender and the loyalty program, each reward credit card works slightly differently. Most credit cards that offer over 100,000 bonus points usually earn the cardholder points for every dollar they spend. When you&rsquo;ve accrued enough bonus points, you can redeem the points for travel, flight upgrades, frequent flyer points, accommodation, gift cards, merchandise and other loyalty rewards.</p>\n<h3>Is it worth applying for credit cards with 100,000+ bonus points?</h3>\n<p>The general rule of thumb is that the more you spend on your rewards card, the better sense they make. To get the most out of a credit card rewards program, you&rsquo;ll need to do your research to make sure that the amount of points you earn is worth the additional fees and higher interest rates you could be paying. If you regularly shop at a particular supermarket or petrol station, a reward credit card that&rsquo;s linked to that store might make the most sense. If you&rsquo;re a jet-setter, a credit card that&rsquo;s linked to a frequent flyer program will get you the greatest return on your spending.</p>\n<p>Typically, reward programs are designed to incentivise cardholders that spend big. If you have a legitimate reason to put all your expenses on your rewards card, it may make sense to earn bonus points if you&rsquo;re spending that money anyway.</p>\n<p>The risk for cardholders that don&rsquo;t spend big is that the points could encourage spending for the sake of points. When you work out the cost of the bonus points and factor in the card fee, it could be detrimental. For cardholders with smaller spending budgets that generally don&rsquo;t pay their full monthly balance, opting for a lower rate card could make better financial sense.</p>\n<h3>What do I look for in credit cards with 100,000+ bonus points?</h3>\n<p>Before you apply for a credit card with 100,000+ bonus points, use our <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards"">online comparison tool</a> to find a reward card that suits your spending and lifestyle. Here are some factors you may consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Point value</strong> Check how many points you&rsquo;ll earn with each dollar spent. The standard ratio is 1 point per $1.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimum spend</strong> Some cards require a minimum monthly spend to get bonus points.</li>\n<li><strong>Points expiry</strong> Points might not last forever, so check for an expiry date to make sure you&rsquo;re not forfeiting any rewards unnecessarily.</li>\n<li><strong>Points capping</strong> Some reward programs cap the number of points you can earn. Check this against what you spend to make sure you come out on top.</li>\n<li><strong>Bonus points</strong> Some cards have the added incentive of earning bonus points. This may be a lump sum when you sign up, if you shop at a specific retailer or if you meet a minimum monthly spend.</li>\n<li><strong>Lifestyle rewards</strong> Some rewards programs are fixed to a certain program, such as a specific frequent flyer program. Check to see this fits your lifestyle or whether flexibility is more important.</li>\n<li><strong>Redemption</strong> Redeeming points should be as easy as earning them. Check the process and timeframe for point redemption.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because you&rsquo;re applying for a credit card, be sure to look beyond the rewards program and compare interest rates, annual or monthly card fees, foreign transaction fees, purchase and cash advance charges and balance transfer costs.</p>",,100,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,10.0,374.0

These points are normally awarded per dollar spent on the credit card. The amount of points per dollar can vary depending on the provider as well as the type of card. Premium and platinum cards tend to offer more points per dollar than entry-level reward cards, with some cards providing up to three points per dollar spent. It is important to consider how many points a card provides per dollar before applying. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Are there any credit cards that come with 20,000 bonus points?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Bonus points are common on reward cards. Bonus points are often awarded once a specific level of spending has been reached on the card within an allocated period of time.&nbsp; These points are normally only awarded for the first year once the spending requirements have been met. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How do you find credit cards that come with 20,000 bonus points?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>RateCity provides product information on many of Australia&rsquo;s major banks and credit lenders.

For a full overview of the card, click through to the product page.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Why do credit cards offer bonus points?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Credit card providers offer bonus points to entice new credit card applications on rewards cards. In comparison to low-rate cards, these rewards cards often come with a higher interest rate as well as higher annual fees. Bonus points can be a way for lenders to distract consumers from these high annual fees and higher interest rates. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What are the pros and cons of credit card rewards?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Reward credit cards offer both positive and negative aspects. It is important to weigh up the pros and cons of using a reward credit card over a traditional low-rate card before applying. Reward credit cards incentivise spending; to make the most of your card it is important that you are spending a reasonable amount on the card every month and can pay it off within the interest-free period. The bonus points offered with reward cards are a great way for consumers to make the most of their cards with points redeemable for flights, upgrades and purchases.</span></p>\n<p><span>It is important to look at both the annual fee and interest rate of the reward card before applying, as many reward cards come with annual fees and a higher interest rate. As bonus points are usually only offered during the first year, it is important to consider whether the card is worthwhile keeping in the long term. Unlike low-rate cards, reward cards are designed to benefit those who spend on the card every month. Annual fees are normally higher on reward cards, so it is important to make sure the value obtainable from the reward points is higher than the annual fee. Individuals who have a low credit card spend may be more suited to a low-rate card with a lower annual fee; choosing a reward card may put them at a loss after the first year.</span></p>",,100,0,3,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,10.45,371.0

And some credit card providers offer 44-day (or longer) interest-free periods for purchases. </span></p>\n<p><span>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the catch?&rsquo; you might ask? Well, there is one&hellip; which we&rsquo;ll explain. The interest-free period &ndash; in our example it&rsquo;s 44 days &ndash; is counted from statement issue date to the payment due date. </span></p>\n<p><span>So while you do get up to 44 days to pay off a purchase without incurring any interest, the count is based on the cycle date of your statement.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you purchase an item 10 days after your last statement has been issued, you then have 34 days to pay for the item in full before interest is applied. </span></p>\n<p><span>For the record, if you don&rsquo;t repay the item in full within the interest-free period, some credit card providers will charge interest from the date of purchase.</span></p>\n<p><span>That&rsquo;s why credit card companies usually mention that you have &ldquo;up to 44 days&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;44 days&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p><span>So rather than having an effective cashflow management tool &ndash; i.e. a credit card with 44 days&rsquo; interest-free &ndash; you end up with a financial burden and evidence of undisciplined spending habits. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s a technicality whether or not you receive the full 44-day interest-free period. Just make sure you&rsquo;re aware of your statement period and &ndash; if you want to get the full 44 days &ndash; make your purchases on the first day of each statement.</span></p>\n<p><span>To fully understand how your 44 days&rsquo; interest-free period is calculated, check your credit card product disclosure statement, terms and conditions or provider&rsquo;s website. </span></p>\n<p><span>Every provider has a different statement cycle period and length of time for the due date. So, it&rsquo;s not as simple as starting at day one each month and counting to 44 for the interest-free days. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Is a credit card with 44 interest-free days right for me?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Something to consider when shopping around for an interest-free credit card is your pay cycle. It&rsquo;s a minor point but could be an aid to maximising the value of your credit card.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span>A credit card with a 44-day interest-free period gives you 44 days from statement issue date to the payment due date to pay for any purchases without interest being charged. </span></p>\n<p><span>Your ability to do this could be impacted by when you get paid. If you're paid bi-monthly (which would be tough) this might create stress when attempting to keep on top of 44-day payments.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s worth attempting to sync your pay days with your credit card cycle as part of a well-managed personal financial system. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How to make the most of your interest-free period?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s quite simple: make sure you pay for any purchases made within each statement period by the due date. Setting up automated payments for the amount you&rsquo;ve spent will ensure you do this. </span></p>\n<p><span>Oh, and if possible, you might want to see if you can make major purchases or pay bills on the first day of each statement cycle. </span></p>\n<p><span>That way you are guaranteeing yourself that interest won&rsquo;t be charged on purchases for the full 44 days.</span></p>\n<p><span>Credit cards can be your best friend if they&rsquo;re managed responsibly. However, there are a few of us out there who might not know just how easy it is to turn credit to our advantage. </span></p>\n<p><span>And you can do this beyond just the interest-free days too. Choosing a competitive credit card might also put you ahead financially &ndash; for example, if you get a rewards card that doesn&rsquo;t have an annual fee, and you pay off the entire bill every month. That way, you earn rewards and never have to pay a cent in fees or interest.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Are some 44 interest-free credit cards days better than others?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>We know that interest-free is interest-free, but what makes a difference to your credit card&rsquo;s bottom line are the fees charged by your provider. </span></p>\n<p><span>And when the fees are charged will also vary between credit card products. An important piece of information here is the fact that different providers will offer different periods for due dates.</span></p>\n<p><span>One credit card provider might calculate a statement cycle as 30 days and provide an additional 14 days for the due date. There&rsquo;s your 44-day interest-free period!</span></p>\n<p><span>Here are a few things to consider when shopping around for a 44-day interest-free credit card:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Look at the annual fee charged </span></li>\n<li><span>Compare the interest rate for purchases</span></li>\n<li><span>Make sure you&rsquo;re OK with the cash advance rate (if this is an important factor)</span></li>\n<li><span>Take into consideration the balance transfer offer (or if there is one)</span></li>\n<li><span>Think about whether you want rewards or other fringe benefits</span></li>\n<li><span>Read the fine print to understand the terms for the 44-day interest free period</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Comparison tools like <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards"">RateCity</a> make this process so much easier for you.

There can be significant variations between interest rates on different cards, as well as the number of interest-free days attached to a card, and that can end up costing the cardholder money.</p>\n<h3>What is credit card interest?</h3>\n<p>The premise of a credit card is that the purchases you make on the card are actually funds borrowed from the bank or financial institution, until the amount is paid off in full. The institution then applies an interest rate percentage figure to any dollar amount that is not paid off in full by the agreed amount of time set out by the card provider.</p>\n<p>The interest amount on top of the amount owed is known as credit card interest.</p>\n<h3>Interest-free periods - how they work</h3>\n<p>You will regularly see attached to a credit card a number of interest-free days you have to pay off the amount you have spent in a statement issued to you each billing cycle. For example, if you have a 55-day interest-free period, that means you have 55 days from the day the statement was issued to pay the purchase amount due to the card provider.</p>\n<h3>Failure to pay</h3>\n<p>If you fail to pay the full amount off during that time, the card&rsquo;s interest rate will be applied to the amount due as an extra payment.</p>\n<h3>Interest-free periods and billing cycles</h3>\n<p>The interest-free period you have may not correspond to your billing cycle.</p>\n<p>Many card providers issue statements each month, while offering 55-day interest-free periods. This means your interest free period may end during the next billing cycle. You need to be aware of when the interest-free period finishes in your next billing cycle.</p>\n<h3>Being smart about your interest-free days</h3>\n<p>Interest-free days provide flexibility with purchases so that you can purchase something early in your billing cycle and then have the remainder of your 55-day period to pay back the purchase amount.</p>\n<p>There are several ways to maximise the benefit of having interest-free days</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purchase as early as you can in the billing cycle</strong>. This allows you more time to pay the amount off within the interest free period. If, for example, you purchase something on day 40 of a 55-day billing cycle, it means you have only 15 days left to make the full payment. Whereas if you made the purchase on day one, you would have the full 55 days to pay the amount off before interest was applied.</li>\n<li><strong>Understand interest-free days apply only to eligible purchases</strong>. The definition of the term &lsquo;eligible purchases&rsquo; varies slightly between different banks and financial institutions, but usually refers to everyday spending.

If you don&rsquo;t pay the full amount due by your interest-free period, or only pay the minimum amount, you will lose your interest-free period until the full amount is paid in the next billing cycle.

But if you&rsquo;re looking at credit cards as a quick fix solution to a problem situation, you need to look at other more effective options.</p>",,660,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,66.0,245.0

Credit cards that have an interest-free period are a great way to manage your cash flow without adding additional interest to your credit card balance. Taking advantage of a credit card with interest-free days can save you paying interest on purchases for 60 days within each billing cycle. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about credit cards with at least 60 interest-free days.</p>\n<h3>What are interest-free days?</h3>\n<p>Most credit cards offer an interest-free period every statement cycle. This window of opportunity is essentially a grace period to pay the bank back without adding any interest charges. Think of it like an interest-free loan for a set period of time. Knowing how to make the most of the interest-free days can save you paying unwanted interest every month. To use the incentive to your advantage, it helps to understand how interest-free days work.</p>\n<p>Most people tend to assume that the interest-free period kicks in when you get your bill. Sadly, this is misleading, as you don&rsquo;t get 60 days interest-free on each individual purchase you make.</p>\n<p>Interest-free days start when your credit card statement cycle begins. For example, if your billing cycle starts on the first of the month and you make a purchase that day, you&rsquo;ve got the full 60 days to pay that money back before interest kicks in. If you buy something using your credit card on the fourth day of your billing cycle, you&rsquo;ve then got 56 days interest-free. The easiest way to keep track of your interest-free days is to check your credit card statement, make a note of when your billing cycle starts and count back from then.</p>\n<p>Some credit cards might give you the flexibility to change the date of your statement cycle. This can be especially useful if you&rsquo;re in between paydays and trying to balance your short-term cash flow with other payments like your mortgage.</p>\n<p>Paying off your credit card balance within the interest-free days will allow you to make purchases without paying interest. This could be ideal if you use a credit card to earn rewards or for short-term cash flow such as spending between monthly paydays.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do interest-free days work?</strong></h3>\n<p>To understand how your interest-free period will work, you&rsquo;ll first need to find out when your statement period starts. You can find this by looking at your credit card statement or by calling your credit card provider.</p>\n<p>Say you&rsquo;ve chosen a credit card with 60 days interest-free and a billing cycle starting on the 1st of the month, running through till the 30th.</p>\n<p>If you buy a new couch on day 1, you have 60 interest-free days to pay that money back before you get charged interest. When the billing cycle ends and your statement arrives, you&rsquo;ll have two options. The first option is to pay the balance in full by the due date specified. This is the option to take if you want to take advantage of your interest-free period. If you don&rsquo;t have the funds or can&rsquo;t pay the full amount by the due date, you&rsquo;ll miss out on the interest-free period and be charged interest on the closing balance until it&rsquo;s all paid in full. The interest charges will usually appear on your next statement.</p>\n<h3>What are common interest-free traps?</h3>\n<p>The most common interest-free misconception is assuming the interest-free period kicks in from the date of purchase. Every billing cycle and credit card have different conditions, so before you purchase any big ticket items, make sure you check the details to avoid incurring extra fees.</p>\n<p>Depending on your cash flow, it might make sense to hold off on any major purchases towards the end of the cycle. Purchases made at the beginning of the cycle enjoy more interest-free days. Delaying your spending till a new billing cycle ticks over lets you take full advantage of the 60 interest-free days.</p>\n<p>Interest-free cards work best if you pay your credit card balance in full each month. Missing the payment date defeats the interest-free period and if the card has a high-interest rate, it could end up costing you more in interest. If you find that you&rsquo;re not able to pay the full closing balance each month, you might be better off transferring your card over to a lower interest rate credit card or a 0 per cent purchase offer credit card.</p>\n<h3>Are interest-free days valid if you have an outstanding balance?</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll only be able to take full advantage of interest-free days if there&rsquo;s no unpaid balance by the payment due date. To use the interest-free period, you&rsquo;ll have to pay your full closing balance on time, every billing cycle. If you have an outstanding balance, you&rsquo;ll be charged interest on the amount listed on the statement. The outstanding balance amount will roll over and continue to accrue interest until it&rsquo;s paid in full.</p>\n<p>If you manage to keep on top of your credit card and pay your full balance each cycle, a credit card with 60 interest-free days can be a very flexible and affordable way to manage your cash flow. Before you choose a card, make sure you do your research and compare a range of different interest-free options.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

You might have made the same decision to buy a pair of shoes using cash &ndash; however, this payment method won&rsquo;t provide you with anything other than the shoes.</p>\n<p>By using a credit card to purchase the shoes, you could accumulate points that contribute toward a future holiday or another five pairs of shoes.</p>\n<p>Points are a reward system that places a point value on all credit card transactions. A credit card offering 80,000+ bonus points puts you in an advantageous purchasing position.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Credit cards offering bonus points &ndash; if managed with financial discipline &ndash; can add value to your budget.

The points may not be a given either; check whether there&rsquo;s a minimum spend.</p>\n<p>When it&rsquo;s a credit card offering 80,000 bonus points as an existing customer, this gives you the ability to earn these extra points per statement cycle when you meet the spending requirements.</p>\n<p>How you can spend the points will vary from credit card to credit card &ndash; although most credit card providers allow points to be carried over to other reward programs.</p>\n<p>An example of this is Qantas Points and frequent flyer points, which can be earned through spending on a range of major credit cards.</p>\n<p>How many points per dollar you earn from your spending will also depend on the provider.

So, what are they exactly?</span></p>\n<p><span>Rewards are a point-system whereby you can earn points simply by using your credit card. The points accrued can be converted into goods or services and discounts.</span></p>\n<p><span>Rewards programmes are designed to give you fringe benefits for your loyalty. By using your credit card as your preferred payment method, you are rewarded via the point-system. </span></p>\n<p><span>However not all credit cards offer rewards, and different credit card providers offer different types of rewards. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some of the most popular credit card rewards programmes are for flights and travel. You might be familiar with frequent flyer points associated with Flybuys, Qantas or Virgin‰Ûªs Velocity program. åÊ</span></p>\n<p><span>A growing number of credit card providers are offering customers points that can be earned and redeemed with major airlines. </span></p>\n<p><span>Airlines are also establishing membership programs that reward members for loyalty to the brand. One such reward scheme is Air New Zealand‰Ûªs ‰Û÷Airpoints‰Ûª. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What is Airpoints?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Airpoints is Air New Zealand‰Ûªs answer to frequent flyer points, which earns its loyal members Airpoints Dollars that can be spent on air travel, car hire and accommodation. </span></p>\n<p><span>In addition to earning Airpoints Dollars, the Airpoints programme lets you accrue membership status points. The more status points you earn, the more likely your membership will be upgraded.</span></p>\n<p><span>Through status points, you could elevate your membership to silver, gold or elite, which gives you access to a greater range of benefits to spend your Airpoints Dollars on.</span></p>\n<p><span>You might be happy to know that you don‰Ûªt need to be a frequent flyer (not all of us are) to grow your Airpoints or spend your Airpoints Dollars.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What are the benefits of Airpoints?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>You already know that being a frequent flyer is not a pre-requisite for Airpoints membership. That said, most of the member rewards are travel-related.</span></p>\n<p><span>One of the main benefits of an Airpoints membership is the ability to earn Airpoints Dollars that can be redeemed as flights and upgrades, car hire, travel insurance or a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.airnewzealand.com.au/koru"">Koru membership</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span>There are literally thousands of flights you can purchase using your Airpoints Dollars with Air New Zealand, one of its partner airlines or on selected star alliance flights. </span></p>\n<p><span>Participating Airpoints partner airlines include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Virgin Australia </span></li>\n<li><span>Etihad</span></li>\n<li><span>Cathay Pacific </span></li>\n<li><span>Jet Airways </span></li>\n<li><span>Virgin Atlantic</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Star alliance has more than 18,500 daily flights to nearly 1,500 destinations in 192 countries that you can spend Airpoints Dollars on. </span></p>\n<p><span>As an Airpoints member, you also have the option to use your Airpoints Dollars on hire cars from Avis or Budget and choose from a range of travel insurance policies for your next holiday.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How can I earn Airpoints Dollars?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>You can start earning Airpoints Dollars by simply joining the free Airpoints programme.

You can earn Airpoints Dollars by booking your accommodation directly with one of them. </span></p>\n<p><span>Air New Zealand has also partnered with a number of leading financial services organisations, each of which offers an associated credit card product. </span></p>\n<p><span>Reward points earned through these partner credit cards can be converted into Airpoints Dollars. However, you don‰Ûªt have to have a credit card to earn Airpoints Dollars. </span></p>\n<p><span>There‰Ûªs the option to earn Airpoints Dollars by making purchases with participating retailers.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How can I spend Airpoints Dollars?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Airpoints Dollars are not convertible into cash; however, you can use them to redeem rewards. The list of rewards available is regularly updated; you can check out the current list <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.airnewzealand.com.au/spending-airpoints-dollars"">here</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span>As an Australian member, any Airpoints Dollars you earn will be converted into Australian dollars where applicable. </span></p>\n<p><span>And just for the record, you can‰Ûªt transfer your Airpoints Dollars or Status Points to another airline&#8217;s frequent flyer programme (in case you were wondering). </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Do Airpoints Dollars expire?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>The good news is that your Airpoints Dollars are valid for four years from the date of accrual (or the date of purchase). After that, they will expire and be removed from your account. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Is the Airpoints reward program for me?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you‰Ûªre not much of a traveller, you might want to consider a different rewards program. As an Airpoints member, you can earn Airpoints Dollars easily enough, but if you don‰Ûªt plan on traveling‰Û_ there‰Ûªs not much opportunity to redeem those dollars (or points) earned. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you‰Ûªre a Kiwi or someone who often travels across the ditch, the Airpoints reward program might be advantageous, particularly within New Zealand. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How do I decide which is the best Airpoints reward credit card? </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Each Airpoints credit card partner offers a unique credit card product that carries with it an Airpoints Dollars conversion rate. </span></p>\n<p><span>Which credit card appeals to you will depend on what you want out of your credit card ‰ÛÒ aside from the Airpoints membership benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span>When making your decision it‰Ûªs worth comparing features such as fees and charges, the list of participating reward partners, and of course how the points can be used outside of Airpoints. </span></p>\n<p><span>Air New Zealand offers Airpoints members a range of selected credit card products. Each credit card gives you the ability to earn Airpoints Dollars while delivering the regular features of a credit card. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What other airlines have reward programs?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Other major airlines offering well-established reward programs are Qantas and Virgin Australia. Qantas Frequent Flyers earn Qantas points, while Virgin has the Velocity Frequent Flyer program.</span></p>\n<p><span>Like Air New Zealand‰Ûªs Airpoints program, Qantas and Virgin Australia give members a range of credit card options to choose from. </span></p>\n<p><span>Many banks in Australia offer credit cards that allow you to earn Qantas Points, which are automatically credited to your Qantas Frequent Flyer account. </span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, you must be a member of the Qantas Frequent Flyer program to earn and redeem Qantas Points. </span></p>\n<p><span>Qantas goes on step further than the competition by offering Qantas Points on select transaction and savings accounts, home and car loans, insurance products and online trading accounts.åÊ </span></p>\n<p><span>Virgin Australia gives you two options to turn your credit or charge card spend into Velocity Points. One way is by using a Velocity co-brand credit card; these are tailored to the Velocity program. </span></p>\n<p><span>Or you can use a participating partner credit card which allows you to transfer your existing reward points to your Velocity account.</span></p>\n<p><span>Velocity Points can be transferred from participating hotel, credit card, charge card and shopping rewards partners. And redeemed for flights, upgrades, car hire, fuel, merchandise or hotels.</span></p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

Because your credit file is checked every time you apply for a credit card, a bad credit score can affect your chances and complicate the process.</p>\n<p>There is no universal definition of bad credit, so each lender will have their own criteria for what they classify as bad credit. If you&rsquo;ve got bad credit, you may have some negative incidents listed on your credit file. These could be historical defaults, late or missed payments, bankruptcy or even multiple credit card applications.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a bad credit rating or a low credit score, you might not have as many options available to you, but you can still apply for a credit card. If you think you may have bad credit, and you&rsquo;re in the market for a credit card, it&rsquo;s important to compare all your options and do your research to make sure you&rsquo;re getting the best deal and working towards improving your credit rating.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about getting a credit card if you have a bad credit score.</p>\n<h3>What is my credit score?</h3>\n<p>Your credit score is calculated by a credit reporting agency that will collect your financial and personal information and create a credit report. It will look at information like where you live and what types of credit you have with certain providers like utilities and banks. It will also look at the amount of credit you&rsquo;ve borrowed and the number of applications and loan enquiries you&rsquo;ve made. Once all the information is collected, the credit reporting agency will give you a credit score or rating which will determine if you have good or bad credit.</p>\n<p>When you apply for a credit card or any other type of loan, the lender will look at your credit file and make a judgement call on your application. If you don&rsquo;t have any defaults and have an excellent credit score, you may have a lot more options and could benefit from lower interest rates. On the other hand, if you have a bad credit rating, your credit options will be more limited and you could find yourself paying higher fees and interest rates on loans like credit cards.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no universal formula for measuring your credit score and each lender and credit reporting agency will have their own criteria for determining defaults and ratings. It&rsquo;s important that you keep an eye on your credit rating and make sure you&rsquo;re keeping your finances and debt under control.</p>\n<p>While having bad credit can make it difficult to get a credit card and home loan, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world. It&rsquo;s still possible to apply for a credit card with bad credit using a reputable lender.</p>\n<p>Before you apply for a bad credit credit card, it pays to check your credit rating and your credit history report. There are some free options available like mycreditfile.com.au and checkyourcredit.com.au.</p>\n<h3>Can I get a credit card with bad credit?</h3>\n<p>In Australia, it&rsquo;s not currently possible to get a credit card without a credit check. While this may seem inconvenient, it&rsquo;s in your best interest if you&rsquo;ve got bad credit. An application for a credit card when you have bad credit may show up on your credit file and make matters worse. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that you don&rsquo;t have any credit options, but you will need to work on improving your credit rating and consider some other loan options.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got bad credit and you&rsquo;re looking for a credit card, your options include:</p>\n<p><strong>Debit cards</strong></p>\n<p>A debit card looks and functions the same way as a traditional credit card, but instead of using the bank&rsquo;s money, it deducts the money from your own funds. While a debit card will have no effect on improving your credit rating, it will stop you from getting into more debt. You don&rsquo;t need a perfect credit rating to use a debit card and you can use it to pay for items online or over the phone.</p>\n<p><strong>Bad credit personal loans</strong></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got bad credit and can&rsquo;t get a credit card, bad credit personal loans might be worth exploring. While the interest rate is generally higher than other loans on the market and you may not have as many options as other personal loans, they can be a good option if you need extra cash quickly.</p>\n<p>You could also consider pre-paid credit cards and bad credit payday loans. Before applying for any bad credit loan, always check the interest rate and make sure that you can make the repayments on time to avoid making your bad credit worse.</p>\n<h3>Options for improving bad credit</h3>\n<p>If you keep applying for credit cards even though you have a bad credit rating, and if your applications keep getting rejected, this will show up on your credit file, making the process harder. If your credit card application has been rejected due to bad credit, here are some things to consider to turn your credit rating around.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay off other loans or credit</strong></p>\n<p>When a lender assesses your credit card application, they&rsquo;ll look at your repayment history on any other cards or loans you have. If you can show that you&rsquo;ve been consistent with meeting your repayments and paying off more than the minimum monthly credit card repayment, you may have a much better chance at improving your credit rating.</p>\n<p><strong>Wait until you can afford the repayments</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, a lender can&rsquo;t legally give you a credit card unless you have enough annual income to meet the card&rsquo;s minimum repayments. If you don&rsquo;t have a regular income or can&rsquo;t prove your income, it&rsquo;s best to hold off applying for a credit card until you&rsquo;re in a better position. Getting rejected by a major lender may show up on your credit report.</p>\n<p><strong>Improve your credit rating</strong></p>\n<p>Before you start working towards clearing your bad credit, it pays to know what your options are. Working on clearing your bad credit rating can make applying for a credit card in the future a much simpler process. If you have existing credit cards, you could potentially lower their limit and look to consolidate any outstanding credit card debt or personal loans. Make sure you pay all your bills, including your mortgage or rent, on time, every month.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got bad credit and you find yourself in a dire financial situation, it may be wise to seek financial counselling before applying for any further loans or credit cards. A professional financial counsellor can help you work through a debt consolidation plan and help facilitate smarter choices to clear your bad debt. If you know you&rsquo;ve got bad debt and you&rsquo;re struggling to make repayments, contact your lender. A proactive approach may help put a plan in place before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>\n<p>For more information on contacting a financial counsellor, visit the ASIC <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/"">MoneySmart website</a>.</p>",,1600,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,160.0,191.5

By lessening or removing the interest payable on a balance, you could get on top of the principal debt. </span></p>\n<h3>The pros of a credit card balance transfer</h3>\n<p><span>Another benefit of a credit card balance transfer is moving to a credit card product that has more to offer. </span></p>\n<p><span>Once upon a time, the only difference between credit card products was the provider and the interest rate. </span></p>\n<p><span>Now there are more differences, so it&rsquo;s worth regularly using a credit card comparison tool to see if your current card stacks up against the competition.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span>Credit card deals available could include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span> Cashback offers for new applicants</span></li>\n<li><span> Ongoing low interest rates</span></li>\n<li><span> No account keeping fees</span></li>\n<li><span> Interest-free days</span></li>\n<li><span> Reward points such as Frequent Flyer and airline points</span></li>\n<li><span> Discounted insurance</span></li>\n<li><span> Retail gift vouchers and more</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Analyse what your current credit card offers and compare it to another product that has a credit card balance transfer. </span></p>\n<p><span>You might find that transferring the balance from your existing provider to another product gives you more benefits other than the transfer itself. </span></p>\n<h3>Does a credit card balance transfer save you money?</h3>\n<p><span>Whether a credit card balance transfer saves you money or not depends on your personal financial management. </span></p>\n<p><span>For most people, the primary motive for a credit card balance transfer is to move a debt balance to a new credit card that has less or no interest on the transferred balance. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s worth noting here that credit card balance transfer deals are usually available for a limited period of time (which will vary depending on the product and provider). </span></p>\n<p><span>If you choose to transfer your credit card balance to a new product to reduce the interest paid on the debt, it&rsquo;s usually a good idea to pay off the carried balance within the timeframe offered. </span></p>\n<h3>How can I make the most of a credit card balance transfer?</h3>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;ve made the decision to transfer your credit card balance to another credit card product, there are some simple steps you can take to potentially gain a financial benefit. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Pay attention to the balance transfer deal</strong></p>\n<p><span>Credit card balance transfer offers are usually available for a limited period of time. </span></p>\n<p><span>To make the most of the balance transfer offer, work out a repayment schedule and stick to it. For example, if the new credit card offers 0 per cent interest on balance transfers for six months, divide the balance owing by the time remaining and setup regular repayments. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Restrict purchases within the balance transfer introductory offer</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span>To give yourself the best chance of paying off the balance transferred, restrict yourself from making purchases using credit during the introductory period. </span></p>\n<p><span>For example, if the new credit card offers a zero balance on transfers for 18 months, try not to make purchases during this time. Instead focus on paying off the carried balance. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Take advantage of additional offers such as interest-free days</strong></p>\n<p><span>The overall benefit of interest-free days on credit card purchases and spending is that it helps you manage your cashflow. </span></p>\n<p><span>Most income is periodical or intermittent, which means that it usually comes and goes in lump sums on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly cycle. </span></p>\n<p><span>By strictly managing your cashflow, you could use any spare funds to repay the balance transferred from the old credit card. </span></p>\n<p><span>Interest-free days on a credit card give you an extended period of time to repay transactions without accruing any interest. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s worth noting that if you fail to repay the transactions made within the interest-free period, interest kicks in and is applied to the balance owing. </span></p>\n<h3>I&rsquo;ve transferred my credit card balance. What now?</h3>\n<p><span>Credit card balance transfers could help you to get on top of credit card debt while offering a range of benefits such as low or no fees, reward points, discounted insurances and interest-free days.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are some simple steps you can take to make the most of your credit card once you&rsquo;ve transferred your balance to a new product. </span></p>\n<p><span>The following list offers some examples of healthy credit card habits to help you maximise the benefit of a credit card balance transfer:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Monitor your spending</strong> by keeping a list of credit card purchases. Keeping a list of credit card purchases will help you track your spending and determine whether you&rsquo;re spending within your budget. </span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Make repayments on time</strong>, and aim to pay more than the required minimum. Read your credit card statement to find out the repayment due date &ndash; late payments often result in extra interest charges or late payment fees. </span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Set a lower credit limit</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t have a need for a high credit limit, don&rsquo;t set one. If you lack discipline when it comes to spending, a higher credit limit might lead you to live outside of your means. </span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Try not to use credit to pay off other debts</strong> if that can be avoided. Factor recurring debts, such as mortgage repayments, rent, utility bills and living expenses, into your regular cashflow budget. If you can&rsquo;t manage day-to-day living costs, you may need to seek the advice of a financial advisor or counsellor to help get you back on track. </span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Use the interest-free days</strong> to repay purchases. Interest-free credit card purchases are available for a limited period of time. Ensure you know what purchases you make for each statement period and when they need to be repaid before interest is applied. </span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Carefully check your credit card statement</strong> to ensure accuracy. Compare your list of credit card purchases against your statement to ensure they match. Make a note of any additional fees charged and look at ways of avoiding them next time. </span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Ensure the account is completely settled</strong>, when you pay off the credit card. If you transferred your credit card balance with the aim of paying it off and closing the account, make sure you do it properly. Cutting up a card is not closing the account, so speak to your provider to find out how to do this to prevent further use of the card. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Make the most of a credit card balance transfer</h3>\n<p><span>Transferring a credit card balance from one product to another could be a smart move if you approach the practice sensibly. </span></p>\n<p><span>Balance transfers are not just useful for people who can&rsquo;t manage debt; they can also be advantageous for people wanting fringe benefits for their spending. </span></p>\n<p><span>The credit market is always changing, and more providers and products are continuously becoming available. </span></p>\n<p><span>Credit card balance transfers give you the ability to jump onto a better deal and possibly save money and gain financial benefit in the process.</span></p>",,12100,3123,10275,9307,851057,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,90814.50000000001,3.0

Credit card providers are always on the lookout for new customers, and one way of bringing you over is by offering a highly incentivised interest rate on balance transfer deals.</p>\n<h3>What is a balance transfer card?</h3>\n<p>A balance transfer card works by literally taking your credit balance from one card and transferring the whole amount over to a new credit card with an incentivised and more affordable interest rate. Generally speaking, balance transfer cards offer 0 per cent promotional rates for a set period of time, which is anywhere between three and 12 months. After the honeymoon period ends, the interest rate usually shoots up and can leave you with a whole lot more in interest and fees.</p>\n<p>For a balance transfer card to work in your favour, you&rsquo;ll ideally need to pay off the balance while the promotional interest rate is still 0 per cent. In some cases, there may be additional fees if you still have an outstanding balance when the promotional period ends. Before you apply for a balance transfer card, make sure you compare your options and leave yourself enough time to pay off your debt.</p>\n<p>If you decide that a balance transfer card is right for you, the actual process of rolling your balance over to a new card is relatively simple. When you fill out the application, you&rsquo;ll provide the name of your current credit card along with the card number. Once you&rsquo;re approved, the new card provider will reduce the balance of your old card to $0 and transfer it to the new card.</p>\n<h3>What is a 0% balance transfer card?</h3>\n<p>Some balance transfer cards offer an introductory 0 per cent interest rate when you transfer your existing balance onto a new credit card. A 0 per cent interest rate is usually valid for a fixed period of time and literally charges you no interest on the amount you transfer over. Depending on the card, you may be charged a one-time transfer fee when you move the balance over. A 0 per cent interest rate can potentially save you from accruing additional interest while repaying your credit card debt.</p>\n<p>Credit cards with 0 per cent balance transfer are usually available for periods starting from two months up to 24 months.</p>\n<h3>The benefits of a balance transfer card</h3>\n<p>A balance transfer card is a great short-term strategy to save you money and reduce your credit card debt. The major benefit is that you have a definitive period in which to pay back the money you owe without adding any additional interest. Because balance transfer cards are often bundled together with other benefits like reward points or free travel insurance, you might find a credit card that can help you pay off your balance with great benefits.</p>\n<h3>What to look out for when comparing balance transfer cards</h3>\n<p>Before you choose a balance transfer card, make sure you check what happens when the promotional period ends. You specifically want to check what the post-promotional interest rate will be. In most cases, they tend to be on the higher side. If you&rsquo;re not certain you can pay the entire card balance off, do the sums to make sure you're not worse off when the rate reverts back to the standard.</p>\n<p>Some cards also charge an initial fee to transfer the balance over, which is added to the balance on the new card. Before you make the switch, compare any additional card or annual fees against what you&rsquo;re currently paying to ensure you come out on top.</p>\n<p>A common misconception with balance transfer cards is that you don&rsquo;t have to pay anything during the promotional period. This is not the case. Even if the card offers you a 0 per cent interest rate, you still have to pay the minimum balance each month. If the balance transfer card has a period of interest-free days, you won&rsquo;t be able to take advantage of this until you&rsquo;ve paid the entire balance off.</p>\n<p>When the incentives are so appealing, it can be tempting to apply for multiple balance transfer deals. Every time you make an application for a credit card, it gets recorded on your credit report.</p>\n<h3>How to use a balance transfer card to consolidate debt</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a manageable amount of credit card debt which you can pay off within the card&rsquo;s promotional period, then a balance transfer card might be worth considering.</p>\n<p>The main consideration with balance transfer cards is what happens when the honeymoon period ends. If you&rsquo;ve done the maths and it&rsquo;s not likely that you&rsquo;ll pay the card off before the promotional rate ends, you might be better off exploring other debt consolidation options, like a personal loan.</p>\n<p>Before you make a decision, <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards/balance-transfer"">do your research and compare</a></span> your options to make sure you find a balance transfer card that works for you.</p>",,10,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.0,522.0

It can be easy to be discouraged from paying down your debts aggressively, or even regularly, as you watch them gain more and more interest every month.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling to pay off debt, especially from multiple sources, a balance transfer credit card could be an option for you. There are even some credit cards with a balance transfer of 18 months or more.</p>\n<h3>What is a balance transfer credit card?</h3>\n<p>Many credit card providers have a balance transfer offer for new customers. This allows you to transfer your existing credit card (or other personal) debt to your new credit card, and start paying it off at the promotional interest rate for a set period of time.</p>\n<p>Many providers offer a 0 per cent interest rate for the promotional period, which could give you some breathing room to stop paying interest on your existing debt, and put together a payment plan to get yourself out of debt.</p>\n<h3>I can pay off debt with another credit card?</h3>\n<p>As unrealistic as that may sound, it&rsquo;s entirely possible to pay off your debt using a balance transfer credit card. However, whether or not your debt gets paid off during the promotional period will depend entirely on you and the repayments you make. It&rsquo;s important to crunch the numbers on your own debt.</p>\n<p>Unless you have a small amount of debt that can be realistically be paid off in less than 12 months, you might consider shopping around for a balance transfer of at least 18 months. This longer promotional period gives you more time to pay off your debt at 0 per cent interest, but also more time for slip-ups and human error to interfere with your goal.</p>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to throw off your debt repayment goals is to use your balance transfer credit card for personal or everyday expenses. Unless you know that you can pay off these expenses almost immediately, it&rsquo;s usually not a good idea to add more debt to your balance transfer credit card. If you need to, put your new credit card in a safe place, even with a trusted family member or friend, to avoid using it for everyday expenses.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to be enticed by the 0 per cent interest rate into adding more debt - large or small - onto your credit card. But bear in mind that the 0 per cent period comes with an expiration date.</p>\n<h3>So what happens after the interest-free period?</h3>\n<p>Unless your debt is down to zero by the time the promotional, 0 per cent interest rate period ends, you will immediately start paying interest on your credit card balance. If you do choose a balance transfer credit card, it&rsquo;s important to be aware and prepared for the end of your interest-free period.</p>\n<p>You should also not neglect to consider the interest rate itself. Balance transfers with a 0 per cent interest rate usually make up for their generosity by reverting to a high interest rate of approximately 20 per cent. This means that if you still have $1,000 of debt on your credit card at the end of your interest-free period, you could instantly add an additional $200 to your debt when your interest rate reverts.</p>\n<h3>What other fees and charges should I consider?</h3>\n<p>As with all credit cards, you should consider the standard interest rate, annual fee (what you pay each year for the privilege of having a credit card) and late payment fee when considering your options.</p>\n<p>Another fee that is unique to balance transfers is the balance transfer fee. This is a percentage - usually less than 2 per cent - of your overall debt that your credit card provider will charge you to transfer your debt from other sources to your new credit card. There are, however, many providers who do not charge this fee, so it&rsquo;s important to consider whether you are willing to pay an additional amount to transfer your debt.</p>\n<h3>Should I pay off my debt with a balance transfer credit card?</h3>\n<p>Balance transfer credit cards and their interest-free periods can be very enticing if you have existing debt that is currently collecting interest. But before making any decisions about committing to a new credit card, you should make a watertight plan of how much you can pay off your debt every month, and how long this will take to pay off the balance in full.</p>\n<p>Allow several months of &lsquo;wriggle room&rsquo; to account for unforeseen expenses and human error. For example, if you work out that you can pay off your debt in exactly 15 months, consider a balance transfer with at least an 18-month interest free period. If you pay it off early, all the better.</p>\n<p>Once you know your limits and what you can realistically commit to, you will have a better idea of whether a balance transfer credit card is right for you.</p>",,10,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.0,522.0

Some credit cards have low interest rates, while other credit cards have high interest rates. While the latter might offer attractive credit card bonuses, perks and rewards for the card holder, they can be difficult to pay off.</span></p>\n<p><span>A balance transfer allows the owner of one or more credit cards to transfer their debt from one lender to another, often to take advantage of a comparatively lower interest rate.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<h3>Why would someone perform a balance transfer?</h3>\n<p><span>There are a few reasons why a credit card owner might be looking to transfer their debt from one of their credit cards to another using a credit card balance transfer:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Get on top of your debts &ndash;</span></strong><span> One of the main reasons someone might be looking to perform a credit card balance transfer is to get on top of their debts. A credit card balance transfer deal can see you pay off a transferrable amount within the no- or low-interest period, without having to worry about the higher interest rates of your standard card. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Cash back and discounts &ndash;</span></strong><span> Credit cards offering balance transfers for at least 24 months might also have cash back offers and attractive discounts for the person holding the credit card to take advantage of once they&rsquo;ve made the credit balance transfer. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Reward schemes &ndash;</span></strong><span> Some credit cards might offer points for every dollar you spend, which might be more attractive than those offered by the card you&rsquo;re currently using. Transferring your credit balance could potentially be a way for the card holder to earn more points. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How do credit cards with balance transfers for at least 24 months&rsquo; work?</h3>\n<p><span>Some credit cards offer interest-free balance transfers for at least 24 months, which can be an effective way to consolidate and ultimately repay your credit card debt. </span></p>\n<p><span>These credit cards offer 0 per cent interest on bank transfers for two years, and can provide an ideal way to address the burden of your credit card debt, without having to worry about the burden of additional interest. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, it is important to note that once this credit card promotion ends, any remaining debt balance on your credit card will be charged interest at the standard rate. </span></p>\n<h3>What should I look for when choosing a credit card balance transfers for at least 24 months?</h3>\n<p><span>When comparing credit cards with balance transfers for at least 24 months, there are many factors every credit card holder should take into consideration before signing the dotted line:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>The promotional interest rate &ndash;</span></strong><span> Different credit cards have different interest rates, although it&rsquo;s important to be wary when making your credit card comparison. A credit card with a 0 per cent interest rate for 24 months might seem like an attractive option, but the savings from this could be offset by high annual fees and balance transfer fees. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Annual fees &ndash;</span></strong><span> It&rsquo;s important to make sure the interest savings you will get from the credit card exceed the annual fee. While cards with high annual fees generally offer attractive perks and bonuses, they&rsquo;re not necessarily ideal for people looking to consolidate debt. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Balance transfer fee &ndash;</span></strong><span> This is the amount you pay when moving your credit card balance from one account to the other. Generally, the higher the amount you want to transfer from one card to another, the higher the credit card balance transfer fee.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Standard interest rate &ndash;</span></strong><span> Credit cards with 0 per cent balance transfer rate for the first 24 months will revert to the standard interest rate once the promotion is over, so it&rsquo;s important you&rsquo;re aware of and comfortable with this rate. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the disadvantages of using credit card balance transfers?</h3>\n<p><span>While a credit card with free balance transfers for at least 24 months can be an effective way to consolidate debt, and get a handle on your finances, there are disadvantages:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>High fees and charges &ndash;</span></strong><span> In some cases, the savings offered by the low interest rate of your credit card can be offset by the high fees and charges issued by the provider. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Honeymoon period is temporary &ndash;</span></strong><span> It&rsquo;s also important to remember that this low interest rate is temporary, and once the promotion is over you&rsquo;ll be left with a higher interest rate. This can be dangerous if you haven&rsquo;t paid off the amount when the transfer period ends. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>New purchases might be at higher rates &ndash;</span></strong><span> If you&rsquo;re making new purchases on the card rather than just paying off your balance, it&rsquo;s important to remember that these are sometimes in accordance with the standard interest rate, negating any benefit of the card.</span></li>\n</ul>",,10,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.0,522.0

This is referred to as a &lsquo;no fee&rsquo; balance transfer.</p>\n<p>Card providers will offer this deal in a bid to attract people to switch from their current provider to a new card provider so they can save money.</p>\n<p>However, despite some card providers offering a zero balance transfer fee, they may then apply a higher interest rate or annual fee to the card in an effort to offset some of the commercial income they have forfeited by offering the balance transfer deal.</p>\n<h3>How do you find&nbsp;a balance transfer deal with no fees?</h3>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re investigating options being offered on various cards in relation to finding a balance transfer deal with no fees, there are several questions you need answered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long does the no fee balance transfer period last? Some banks and financial institutions will vary substantially between their introductory periods, so it&rsquo;s worth shopping around.</li>\n<li>Is there a limit to how much you can transfer from another card? The card provider may have a particular policy on how much of the credit card limit can be attributed to a balance transfer.</li>\n<li>Despite a zero fee on the balance transfer, is there also an interest rate attached to any balances transferred - and if so, what is that rate? Often a small percentage is applied to an initial balance transfer as a one-off rate.</li>\n<li>What does the interest rate on balance transfers revert to after the promotional period finishes? This can vary significantly between providers, and if you haven&rsquo;t paid off the balance before the period finishes, this increased rate applies to the outstanding balance.</li>\n<li>What is the interest rate and annual fee attached to the same card?</li>\n<li>Are there any other restrictions on where your funds are transferred from? Some card providers may not allow you to transfer funds from one of their cards to another card type. You need to check their policy before you apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to maximise your no fee balance transfer deal</h3>\n<p>Once you have determined that you&rsquo;ve found the best balance transfer deal for you, you need to put strategies into place to ensure you take full advantage of what it offers you.</p>\n<p>The balance transfer deal centres on providing users with the opportunity to pay down debt at no cost. However, you can only achieve this by being disciplined about making repayments that pay off principal and interest over the promotional period so that, ideally, you pay off the whole debt during that period.</p>\n<p>Further spending on top of the balance you have already transferred onto the card will negate any benefit gained from having no fees on the balance transfer amount. Setting a realistic personal and household budget is an effective way of restraining yourself through the promotional period to ensure making the switch to the new card has been financially worth it.</p>\n<h3>Is there an alternative to balance transfers?</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re an existing cardholder looking at different balance transfer deals as a mechanism to pay off debt more quickly, there is another alternative.</p>\n<p>Consolidating the debt into your mortgage, by incorporating the extra amount into your repayment levels, is an option for some people who already have an existing loan and wish to pay down the additional debt accrued on a credit card.</p>\n<p>While this can be an effective way of simplifying your overall debt structure, it does require ongoing control around any spending on the credit card as well as any further drawdowns on the mortgage. A consistent and concerted approach to prudent spending across all your transactions will allow you to keep in control of your finances.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

Which rewards scheme is best? Do I need travel insurance from my card? What about annual fees?</p>\n<p>Finding your way through the credit card maze to arrive at the card that best suits your personal needs can be exhausting, especially when the credit card companies are constantly bombarding us with advertising about their products. So let&rsquo;s look at some the factors that can help you choose the best credit card for you.</p>\n<h3>Why do you want a credit card?</h3>\n<p>Credit card companies aren&rsquo;t charities. They want your money, preferably as much as they can get. They mostly do this by charging you annual fees and interest on your unpaid balance when you don't pay off the full amount owing each month.</p>\n<p>That's not to say that credit cards can&rsquo;t be helpful when used sensibly. They&rsquo;re handy when you're short of cash or just don't want to carry a lot of cash with you. They're a convenient way to pay for everyday things like shopping &ndash; but that convenience also comes with a cost. For example, research has shown that people often spend more when using a credit card than when they use cash.</p>\n<p>So before you apply for a credit card, think about why you want one, how you will most likely use it and, especially, how you will pay for it. Will you use it every day, or just for emergencies? Will you pay off your balance every month, or just the minimum? How important are rewards or frequent flyer points?</p>\n<p>It's not ideal to use a credit card to pay off other debts because a high interest rate, plus other fees and charges, could end up costing you even more in the long run. So if you are having trouble with debt, you might do better to consider a no-interest or low-interest loan, or seek advice from a financial adviser, rather than get a credit card.</p>\n<h3>Getting started &ndash; types of card</h3>\n<p>So, if you&rsquo;ve decided to go ahead with getting a credit card, let's start with a few basic points:</p>\n<p><strong>Interest-free credit cards or balance transfer deals</strong> can be tempting &ndash; but remember that the interest-free period is for a limited time only. If you still have an unpaid balance on your credit card when the offer ends, your interest can jump significantly.</p>\n<p><strong>Low-interest-rate credit cards</strong> usually charge higher annual fees. If you're prepared to accept those higher fees, this type of card can be useful (for example if you purchase often with your card or intend to borrow on it). Paying an annual fee can also make better financial sense than paying a high interest rate, especially if you only make the minimum payment each month.</p>\n<p><strong>Rewards cards</strong> can also come with high annual fees, and they can end up nullifying the rewards benefits. You'll often have to spend a lot to really earn substantial rewards points.</p>\n<h3>Other fees and charges</h3>\n<p>Another thing to consider when looking at credit cards is the fees and charges, which can add a lot to the cost of your card. Look, for example, at whether any of these are included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annual account-keeping fees</li>\n<li>Fees for late payments</li>\n<li>Cash advance fees (on top of interest on cash advances)</li>\n<li>Fees for exceeding your credit limit</li>\n<li>International transaction fees</li>\n<li>Fees for using reward programs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As mentioned above, consider which fees and charges you might be willing to accept in exchange for other features of the card that you want.</p>\n<p>Some credit cards attract a surcharge on purchases, which some retailers might then pass on to you. You&rsquo;re entitled to be properly informed about any surcharge before you pay. If the surcharge is compulsory, then the retailer must clearly display the surcharge alongside the price. Where the surcharge is optional, then the retailer must inform you of the surcharge, as well as any other payment option that allows you to avoid the surcharge.</p>\n<h3>A few words about rewards</h3>\n<p>Do you charge everyday purchases like groceries, petrol and bills to your credit card? Do you pay down your balance each month? If so, a rewards card could help your money work harder.</p>\n<p>Each time you use a rewards card, you&rsquo;ll earn points that can be redeemed for rewards. Common rewards include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cash back &ndash;</strong> Exchange earned points to reduce the balance you owe</li>\n<li><strong>General rewards &ndash;</strong> Redeem rewards points for things like gift cards or magazines</li>\n<li><strong>Instant rewards &ndash;</strong> Receive automatic discounts with participating merchants (for example, $10 off at the supermarket when you reach a certain number of points)</li>\n<li><strong>Frequent flyer &ndash;</strong> Redeem rewards points for airline tickets and upgrades</li>\n<li><strong>Concierge service &ndash;</strong> An on-call service to handle requests such as booking a restaurant or tracking down a product</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of the extra benefits, rewards cards usually have higher interest rates and annual fees than other cards. Think how often you would use the card to decide whether the benefits outweigh the extra cost for you.</p>\n<p>Also, think about the types of benefits you&rsquo;d like. There&rsquo;s no point getting a card with instant rewards for retailers you never visit or for travel perks you don&rsquo;t have time to use.</p>\n<p>Also, be sure to compare points and fees across different programs. For instance, one card with a lower annual fee might require a huge amount of spending to get any useful rewards, while another card with higher annual fee might only need a small amount of purchases to get a reward.</p>\n<h3>Comparing credit cards</h3>\n<p>Of course, an important part of making a choice of credit card is comparing the features of different cards to find the one best suited to you.</p>\n<p>One way to compare different cards is to use the 'key facts sheet' that should be available from all credit card issuers.&nbsp;These contain information on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum repayments</li>\n<li>Interest rate for purchases and cash&nbsp;advances</li>\n<li>Interest rate for balance transfers</li>\n<li>Promotional interest rate (if any)</li>\n<li>Interest-free period (if any)</li>\n<li>Annual and late payment fees (if any)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, comparison websites can be useful to weigh up the features and fees of different credit cards. They are especially helpful for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifying the features you want to compare (e.g. interest rates, fees)</li>\n<li>Shopping around &ndash; The issuer&rsquo;s websites and comparison websites can help you compare key features</li>\n<li>Making a short list of potential cards, based on your research</li>\n<li>Getting more detail &ndash; Once you have narrowed your choice down to a few cards, look at the relevant product disclosure statement (PDS), key fact sheet or other document outlining all the features of the card</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, when using comparison websites, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comparison websites make money in various ways, sometimes through sponsored or promoted links</li>\n<li>The search results may show sponsored links ahead of non-sponsored results that may offer a better deal</li>\n<li>Some comparison sites only cover a portion of the market, not the whole market</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you've settled on a choice, contact the card issuer and ask any remaining questions until you have all the information you want.</p>\n<p>With just some basic research like this, you should be in a good position to apply for the card that best suits your personal needs and habits. That way, your card has the best chance of working for you, and being a convenience rather than a headache.</p>",,4400,15,101,67,24087,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2881.4,55.0

However, it‰Ûªs not always an easy task obtaining cash where and when you need it. So, what options are available when you want to draw on funds in a hurry? </span></p>\n<p><span>There are plenty of banking products on offer ‰ÛÒ such as personal loans or overdrafts ‰ÛÒ but not all types of credit can be accessed on the spot. A convenient solution that doesn‰Ûªt require a complex application process is a cash advance on a credit card. Obviously, to be able to access this type of cash you would need to have a credit card. </span></p>\n<h3>Quick facts about credit card cash advances</h3>\n<p><span>Most credit cards offer cash advances, meaning that you can withdraw cash using your credit card up to your specified credit limit. Or if you‰Ûªve already made purchases using your credit card, your cash advance amount would be whatever credit is left on your account. </span></p>\n<p><span>Cash advances are made in the same way you would withdraw money using a regular bank account card. You can obtain a cash advance at an ATM, a bank branch, or via retail outlets offering cash out with purchases. </span></p>\n<h3>The pros of credit card cash advances</h3>\n<p><span>The main benefit of a cash advance on a credit card is the fact you can withdraw money from just about any ATM. And you don‰Ûªt need to pre-apply for credit in order for the cash to be made available. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you haven‰Ûªt reached your credit limit, you can access cash funds (up to your credit limit) using your PIN. Another handy feature is that you can also withdraw cash with purchases from participating retailers. This type of credit means that you could avoid being caught short of money. </span></p>\n<h3>The cons of credit card cash advances</h3>\n<p><span>Something to keep in mind when considering a cash advance on your credit card is the cost. Depending on the financial institution, there may be additional fees and charges for this service. </span></p>\n<p><span>In most cases, the interest rate applied to cash advances is higher than for regular purchases. And you may not have the advantage of interest-free days for a cash advance ‰ÛÒ which means that interest is applied on the amount withdrawn immediately. </span></p>\n<p><span>To find out the terms and conditions of cash advances for your credit card, visit your provider‰Ûªs website or give them a call.</span></p>\n<h3>Alternatives to credit card cash advances</h3>\n<p><span>If you don‰Ûªt like the idea of paying additional fees or higher interest rates on your credit card, there are alternatives to a cash advance. </span></p>\n<p><span>The most common banking products would be loans such as personal loans or overdrafts. These products require an application process before the funds can be made available to your nominated bank account. </span></p>\n<p><span>Or if you have a home loan, you may be able to redraw funds, but this may depend on whether you are ahead with your <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">mortgage repayments</a> and/or have a redraw facility available. </span></p>\n<div class=""pros-cons"">\n<div class=""pros col-sm-6"">\n<div class=""pro-con-header"">\n<h5 class=""floating-title""><span class=""fa fa-thumbs-o-up""></span>Pros</h5>\n</div>\n<ul id=""pros-section"">\n<li>Immediate access to cash</li>\n<li>Withdraw money from an ATM</li>\n<li>Cash advance amount up to your credit limit</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=""cons col-sm-6"">\n<div class=""pro-con-header"">\n<h5 class=""floating-title""><span class=""fa fa-thumbs-o-down""></span>Cons</h5>\n</div>\n<ul id=""cons-section"">\n<li>Higher interest rate than for purchases</li>\n<li>Additional fees / charges may apply</li>\n<li>No interest-free days</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>",,480,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,48.0,268.0

Because you&rsquo;re essentially cashing-in your rewards points for cash, you can spend your points on anything you like at any retailer you choose.</p>\n<p>Unlike other credit card reward points programs, cards that let you cash-in your points give cardholders more options on how they redeem and spend their rewards points. Traditional rewards programs generally let cardholders choose products or services from a set catalogue of items. Cards that let you redeem rewards points for cash back generally allow you to use the points for everyday spending.</p>\n<p><strong>How do credit cards with cash back work?</strong></p>\n<p>Credit cards with the ability to redeem rewards points for cash back work similarly to other reward or frequent flyer cards, where you earn reward points on eligible purchases. Where these cards differ from other rewards cards is that you can redeem your rewards points and convert them to cash. Once you&rsquo;ve cashed-in the reward points, you can use them to pay for things like products, travel or accommodation.</p>\n<p>There are a few different ways a credit card can offer you cash back. Some cards have an introductory cash back offer for new cardholders. This usually means you&rsquo;ll have to purchase within a specific timeframe to be eligible for the cash back. Other cards let you accrue rewards points and redeem them as a cash back to spend on whatever you like. Other cards may let you use your rewards points as a cash back credit on your account. If you opt for a card with this option, you may be able to use the cash back to pay any card fees or even pay down your card balance.</p>\n<p><strong>How to compare cash back credit cards?</strong></p>\n<p>Cash back is a feature which is attached to a credit card. When you&rsquo;re <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards/reward-programs"">comparing credit cards,</a></span> it&rsquo;s important that you take all the other factors into consideration. Look for a credit card that ideally gives you a good balance between features and value. As appealing as cash back offers are, it always pays to do your research to make sure you come out on top.</p>\n<p>Another factor to consider is the interest rate. Rewards cards tend to have higher rates than standard cards, which is something to consider if you don&rsquo;t manage to pay your card balance off monthly. Pay attention to any annual card fees. In some cases, the annual card fee can be more than the cash back, so do your sums to make sure it&rsquo;s worth it. If you&rsquo;re a big spender, check to see whether there are any caps on the number of points you can earn or redeem.</p>\n<p>If managed properly, credit cards with rewards programs can be a good way to cash in on your spending. As these cards tend to have higher fees and interest rates than other standard credit cards, they can potentially cost you more if you don&rsquo;t manage your money properly. If you tend to only pay off the minimum amount each month, you might be better off considering a <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards/low-rates"">low-rate credit card</a></span> or opting for a card that offers <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards/maximum-interest-free-days"">interest-free days</a></span>.<br /> Before making a decision, make sure you <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards/reward-programs"">compare your options</a></span> to find a cash back credit card that suits your spending habits.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

Planning a trip in the near future? Many credit cards offer points on eligible purchases for various frequent flyer programs, including Cathay Pacific points.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re already using a credit card regularly, for everyday or just larger expenses, having a card that also earns you frequent flyer points could help you to partially, or even entirely, fund your next flight.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are credit card reward points?</strong></h3>\n<p>Reward points are frequently offered as a credit card perk or benefit, in partnership with a particular frequent flyer program, such as Cathay Pacific Asia Miles, Qantas Frequent Flyer or Virgin Velocity Frequent Flyer.</p>\n<p>Points are earned on eligible purchases (most everyday transactions), often at a rate of 0.5, 1 or even 2 points per dollar spent. These points can then be used to fund flights, upgrades, accommodation and other experiences.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are Cathay Pacific points and how do I earn them?</strong></h3>\n<p>Cathay Pacific points are earned through the Cathay Pacific Asia Miles program. The easiest and most efficient way to earn these points, as with all airline reward programs, is through Cathay Pacific and their partner airlines&rsquo; flights. However, if you&rsquo;re not taking a flight every few weeks but still want to build up a good reserve of air miles, a credit card rewards program might be your next best option.</p>\n<p>Unlike other frequent flyer programs, there is no dedicated credit card available in Australia that will earn you Cathay Pacific Asia Miles specifically. However, there are several Australian banks that offer credit cards with the Asia Miles program as a transfer partner. This means that you can &ldquo;exchange"" the reward points you have earned on your credit card for air miles, which can then be redeemed via the Cathay Pacific Asia Miles program. More detailed information can be found on the<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.asiamiles.com/am/en/earn/finance""> Cathay Pacific Asia Miles</a> page.</p>\n<h3>How do I spend Cathay Pacific Points?</h3>\n<p>Cathay Pacific points are known as Asia Miles, and can be redeemed for flights, hotels, car rentals and many other experiences. One of the most cost-effective ways to redeem air miles is by using them for flights.</p>\n<p>You can book flights using your Asia Miles on Cathay Pacific flights, as well as any of the<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.oneworld.com/""> oneworld</a> alliance partner airlines.</p>\n<p>Remember, Asia Miles are valid for three years from the original date accrued. So if you were planning on saving up your Asia Miles for a few years to help fund a big trip, make sure you have your eye on the expiry date.</p>\n<h3>What routes does Cathay Pacific fly?</h3>\n<p>Cathay Pacific has a global network, and flies to cities throughout the Asia Pacific, Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Some of the most common destinations from Australian cities include Hong Kong, Nanjing, Taipei, London, Manila and Seoul.</p>\n<p>But don&rsquo;t forget, you can redeem your Asia Miles points through any oneworld alliance partner airline, including Qantas, British Airways, Japan Airlines and Finnair.</p>\n<h3>Which other airlines have frequent flyer programs?</h3>\n<p>In Australia, the two big players of the frequent flyer programs are Qantas Frequent Flyers and Virgin Velocity Frequent Flyers. However, Australian travellers shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to look outside local rewards programs, as you may find even more value with other programs, such as Asia Miles.</p>\n<p>Other major airlines with their own rewards programs include Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer, Emirates Skywards, Etihad Guest and British Airways Executive Club.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros of credit card reward points?</h3>\n<p>Depending on which credit card you choose, you may even earn several rewards points per dollar spent. Even though rewards points do not convert dollar for dollar, the thought of being rewarded for buying lunch, groceries or any everyday expenses can be very enticing. Depending on your spending habits, you could start building up a good reserve of points within a few months of switching to a credit card with reward points.</p>\n<p>In addition to earning reward points, these types of credit cards usually have other perks included. These might include discounted travel insurance, shopping insurance for purchases made on your credit card, extended warranty and VIP event seating or pre-sales.</p>\n<p>Many reward point credit cards also offer discounted rates, or cash-back offers on particular purchases, usually for a limited time. For example, you might spend $100 at a partner restaurant, and receive $30 back to your credit card. These types of offers incentivise spending and create a sense of urgency due to the limited-time nature of the offer.</p>\n<h3>What are the cons of credit card reward points?</h3>\n<p>So, what&rsquo;s the downside to these reward point credit cards? For starters, when you&rsquo;re looking at a reward points credit card, make sure that you check the annual fee; that&rsquo;s the amount you have to pay each year just to keep the credit card.</p>\n<p>There are some reward point credit cards with a $0 annual fee, but these are few and far between. For some of these cards, the annual fee is <em>hundreds</em> of dollars, a fee rarely so high for other more &lsquo;standard&rsquo; credit cards. If there&rsquo;s a particular credit card you&rsquo;ve heard about, or are considering, make sure you check the annual fee before making any commitments. Many credit card providers will waive the annual fee for the first year for new customers, so this can make it even easier to miss.</p>\n<p>The other potential downside to rewards point credit cards is the interest rates. Reward points credit cards are notorious for high interest rates, usually at or around 20 per cent. If you&rsquo;re in the habit of not paying off your card in full each month, bear in mind how much interest you&rsquo;ll be paying. A high interest rate can quickly turn into credit card debt that you could have trouble paying off.</p>\n<p>Many rewards point credit cards are also designed for big spenders, hence the high annual fee and interest rates. Some of these cards also come with high minimum credit limits of $10,000 or more. If you&rsquo;re concerned that access to this amount of credit could make it difficult for you to control your spending, take this into account before committing to a card.</p>\n<h3>Is a credit card with Cathay Pacific points right for me?</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve weighed up the pros and cons and are ready to find a reward points credit card, earning Cathay Pacific Asia Miles could very well be a good option.</p>\n<p>If you want to earn rewards points to use for flights, and don&rsquo;t want to be restricted to a preferred airline, Cathay Pacific&rsquo;s partnership with oneworld gives you the option to choose from more than 20 partner airlines.</p>\n<p>However, because there is no specific Cathay Pacific credit card available to Australian consumers, you will need to be willing to keep track of your reward points, and then redeem them for Asia Miles in order to take advantage of this scheme.

Few Australians, though, can say they have one of the best credit cards on the market. That&rsquo;s because a surprisingly high number of people have opted for accounts that charge high interest rates and impose high annual fees.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering whether you can find a better credit card than the one you currently own, the answer is almost certainly yes. That&rsquo;s because there are about 200 credit cards on the market.</p>\n<p>Time, then, to begin your research.</p>\n<p>The first place to start is with this credit card deals page. With dozens of different credit card providers in the market, you&rsquo;ll generally find that at least some of them are running a range of short-term special offers. These might include reduced interest rates, longer interest-free terms, lower annual fees, more generous rewards, balance transfer deals (see below) or free incentive gifts.</p>\n<p>The reason credit card providers offer special deals is the same reason businesses in other industries do it &ndash; to attract more customers and generate more revenue. The credit card market is very competitive, so sometimes lenders feel like they need to do something different to stand out.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve explored this deals page, make sure you visit RateCity&rsquo;s <span><a href=""https://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards"">credit card comparison site</a></span> as well. This page features about 200 different credit card products, so it&rsquo;s possible that one provider&rsquo;s regular offer will be even better than another provider&rsquo;s special deal.</p>\n<h3>Interest rates</h3>\n<p>Credit card interest can be extremely costly. At the time of writing, the average interest rate was 16.74 per cent. If you had a card at that rate, here&rsquo;s how much interest you might have to pay, based on four different spending profiles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interest on $5,000 spending per year = $837</li>\n<li>Interest on $10,000 spending per year = $1,674</li>\n<li>Interest on $15,000 spending per year = $2,511</li>\n<li>Interest on $20,000 spending per year = $3,348</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Imagine, though, that you were able to switch from a card charging 16.74 per cent interest to one charging 10.00 per cent. Here&rsquo;s how the numbers would now look:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interest on $5,000 spending per year = $500</li>\n<li>Interest on $10,000 spending per year = $1,000</li>\n<li>Interest on $15,000 spending per year = $1,500</li>\n<li>Interest on $20,000 spending per year = $2,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a way you could reduce your interest charges down to $0. If you pay off your credit card bill in full each month, you&rsquo;ll never have to pay a cent of interest.</p>\n<h3>Annual fees</h3>\n<p>Annual fees are another important thing to consider when comparing credit cards. At the time of writing, the average annual fee was $111 &ndash; yet there were many credit cards on the market with an annual fee of $0.</p>\n<p>That means that if you choose the right card and pay your bills on time, you&rsquo;ll never have to pay a cent in annual fees and never have to pay a cent in interest.</p>\n<p>So don&rsquo;t just look at interest rates when comparing credit cards &ndash; also pay close attention to the annual fees.</p>\n<h3>Rewards</h3>\n<p>You should also look at what rewards program, if any, a particular credit card offers. A rewards program is basically free money &ndash; assuming you don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of making purchases you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise make, just so you can accumulate points.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, rewards programs and annual fees usually go hand in hand, because credit card providers generally use the latter to fund the former. However, if you shop around, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll be able to find at least provider offering rewards without an annual fee.</p>\n<h3>Balance transfers</h3>\n<p>A lot of credit card providers offer balance transfers, which involves transferring your debt from one credit card to another.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, credit card providers will offer special balance transfer deals to entice people to switch from a rival credit card to one of theirs. These deals typically involve temporary interest-rate holidays. To give a hypothetical example, a credit card that typically charges 14.99 per cent interest might drop the rate to 0 per cent for 10 months. Please note that at the end of the balance transfer period, the interest rate would revert to the normal level &ndash; in this case, from 0 per cent to 14.99 per cent.</p>",,1000,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,100.0,216.5

Watch out for reward credit cards that offer a low introductory rate that rises significantly once the introductory period expires.</li>\n<li>Reward limitations &ndash; There are often limitations and caps to earning and collecting rewards on credit cards. Read the fine print to make sure you know the terms of your card.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are Emirates Skywards Miles?</h3>\n<p>Emirates Skywards is the frequent flyer program of Emirates Airline. Skywards Miles are the frequent flyer points you can earn as an Emirates Skyward member.</p>\n<p>Like many other frequent flyer programs, Emirates Skywards is a great way to take advantage of perks such as reduced flight fares and upgrades. Earning Emirates Skywards Miles isn&rsquo;t difficult to do if you frequently travel with Emirates or have an Emirates credit card.</p>\n<h3>How do you earn Emirates points?</h3>\n<p>You can earn Emirate Skywards Miles in three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flying with Emirates or partner airlines Air Mauritius, Alaska Airlines, easyJet, flydubai, GOL, Japan Airlines, Jet Airways, JetBlue, Jetstar, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, S7 Airlines, South African Airways, TAP Portugal and Virgin America.</li>\n<li>Making purchases with non-flight partners including InterContinental Hotels, Hertz, Citibank and others.</li>\n<li>Making purchases using an Emirates credit card.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For every dollar you spend with an Emirates credit card, you can earn a certain number of Skywards Miles, which can vary depending on the offer or any promotions running at that time.</p>\n<h3>How do you spend Emirates points?</h3>\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve briefly touched upon, Emirates Skywards Miles can be used to redeem a variety of rewards.</p>\n<p>In line with other frequent flyer programs, you can spend points on flights with Emirates or partner airlines. Depending on the number of points you have, you may be able to fly for free or upgrade your ticket at no extra cost.</p>\n<p>Emirates Skywards also offers Cash+Miles, which means you can pay for flights using a combination of accrued points and cash. You can choose how many points to put towards the cost of your ticket, starting from 2,000 points.</p>\n<p>Along with flight rewards, you can also spend Emirates Skywards Miles on other purchases like hotel accommodation, event tickets or even donate to charity.</p>\n<h3>How long do Emirates Skywards Miles last?</h3>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve accrued Emirates Skywards Miles by making purchases on your credit card or otherwise, your points will be valid for three years. Within the calendar year that your points are due to expire, they will be removed from your account at the end of your birthday month.</p>\n<p>Many other airlines also set an expiry date for customers&rsquo; frequent flyer points or conditions for keeping them. Qantas Points, for example, don&rsquo;t expire but you need to earn or use them at least once every 18 months to keep them.</p>\n<h3>Can Emirates points be transferred?</h3>\n<p>Skywards Miles can be transferred online to another Emirates Skywards account for a fee. This means if you earn points on your Emirates credit card, you can transfer them to another person so they can spend them on flight rewards and other purchases.</p>\n<h3>Where does Emirates fly to?</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re weighing up whether to choose a credit card with Emirates points over another airline partner card, you might be wondering if Emirates flies to destinations you&rsquo;d like to travel to.</p>\n<p>The good news is that Emirates flies to more than 100 destinations in Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Europe and Australia. That means if you&rsquo;re shopping around for credit cards with Emirates points, you can be fairly confident that your earned Emirates Skyward Miles will get you where you want to go.</p>\n<p>And don&rsquo;t forget that you can use your Emirates points to go towards flights with their partner airlines as well. So even if Emirates doesn&rsquo;t fly to a destination you&rsquo;re planning to travel to, one of their partner airlines may do so.</p>\n<h3>Other airlines with credit card partnerships</h3>\n<p>Alongside Emirates, there are a number of other airlines with branded credit cards that offer you the chance to earn frequent flyer points for spending:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Qantas &ndash; Most major providers in Australia offer credit cards that allow you to earn Qantas Points</li>\n<li>Virgin &ndash; Most major providers in Australia offer credit cards that allow you to earn Virgin Velocity points, and there are several dedicated Virgin Money Velocity credit cards</li>\n<li>Jetstar &ndash; Branded credit cards are available that can be used to earn Jetstar miles or Qantas Points</li>\n<li>Air New Zealand &ndash; Several partner credit cards are available from providers like American Express, ANZ, NAB and Westpac</li>\n<li>Malaysia Airlines &ndash; Several partner credit cards are available from providers like American Express, Citibank, HSBC, Westpac and St George</li>\n<li>Singapore Airlines &ndash; Providers like American Express, ANZ and Citibank offer credit cards that allow you to earn KrisFlyer points</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As well as dedicated airline credit cards, there are also several other credit cards on the market through which you can earn frequent flyer miles with programs, like flybuys.</p>",,390,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,39.0,283.0

Extended warranty is often available on a &ldquo;platinum&rdquo; or &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; credit card, as one of several perks.</p>\n<p>Extended warranty itself is an additional insurance that extends the life of the retailer or manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty on your purchases. For example, if you purchased a microwave with a three-year Australian warranty, you could potentially extend that warranty by one additional year through your credit card insurance.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, this extended warranty comes into effect only once the Australian warranty on your purchase expires. So, if you found yourself with a faulty microwave after three and a half years, that&rsquo;s when you would look to make a claim via your credit card insurance.</p>\n<h3>What can the extended warranty be used for?</h3>\n<p>Since this type of insurance <em>extends</em> the life of a warranty already in place, extended warranty is generally available on retail and personal purchases. Think of your big-ticket items that already come with warranties in place: electronics, white goods and the like.</p>\n<p>Different credit card providers will have different insurance policies in place that dictate what their extended warranties do and do not cover. So, if you were planning on purchasing that washing machine on your credit card to take advantage of the extended warranty, make sure you look up the actual insurance policy and read through the product disclosure statement (PDS.) This will outline what you can and cannot claim, and by how much your warranty will be extended.</p>\n<h3>How do you use the extended warranty?</h3>\n<p>The first step to claiming extended warranty is to make sure your items are actually covered by this insurance. Some providers will automatically cover &ldquo;eligible purchases&rdquo; made on your credit card, but others will require you to actually register the item or items. This shouldn&rsquo;t cost you anything, but it does mean more paperwork and organisation on your part.</p>\n<p>When it comes to making a claim you will need to show proof of purchase, and this means keeping your receipts. This is also to prove that the item was purchased on your credit card, and thus eligible for extended warranty insurance in the first place.</p>\n<p>Once you have an eligible purchase and your proof of purchase sorted, you will need to contact your credit card provider and fill out a claims form to start the process.</p>\n<h3>Pros of extended warranty credit cards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended cover for your personal purchases</li>\n<li>Eligible purchases are automatically covered by some providers</li>\n<li>No need to purchase extended warranties via the retailer</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons of extended warranty credit cards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended warranty often comes bundled with other perks on a high-interest credit card - make sure you can afford the interest rate</li>\n<li>There is usually a high annual fee on these credit cards</li>\n<li>Not everything is covered - make sure you understand what you can and cannot claim before making any purchases</li>\n</ul>",,5,0,3,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.95,541.0

Fraudsters can also trick people in to giving their credit card details by pretending there is an official reason for the card details to be shared (e.g. pretending to be calling from a bank or charity).</p>\n<p>Another security issue arises with contactless or &lsquo;tap-and-go&rsquo; payment technology. If you lose your card, another person finding it can make numerous transactions under $100 (which don't require your signature or PIN) before you find out.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is fraud protection?</strong></h3>\n<p>Fraud protection (also sometimes known as &lsquo;zero liability policy&rsquo;) is a type of safeguard for credit card users against theft&nbsp;and fraud related to their cards. If your card is used in an unauthorised, fraudulent or illegal transaction that you had no knowledge of, your credit card issuer will reimburse you for the money spent fraudulently in your name, and won&rsquo;t hold you responsible. It&rsquo;s like a type of insurance for your credit. You&rsquo;ll need to get in touch with the card issuer as soon as possible, but the process takes time and the missing money will be unavailable while you&rsquo;re waiting for it to be resolved.</p>\n<p>Fraud protection should cover unauthorised transactions made in-store using the physical card, over the telephone using the card number and CVV, via online shopping, and&nbsp;contactless payments made with a smartphone or mobile device.</p>\n<p>This sort of fraud protection is one of the significant benefits of using a credit card over cash. Different credit card issuers will have slightly different policies when it comes to fraud protection, so&nbsp;you should ask about the specifics of your card&rsquo;s policy in order to avoid being caught out.</p>\n<h3><strong>Other fraud protections</strong></h3>\n<p>Some credit cards have round-the-clock security that monitors your spending patterns. Then, if the company identifies a transaction as suspect or unusual, it will try to get in touch with you to make sure it&rsquo;s actually you making the transaction. If the company can&rsquo;t reach you, it may decide to block your account until you can confirm it.</p>\n<p>Credit cards may also have embedded security microchips that make it harder for credit card details to be fraudulently copied. When a chipped card is used to purchase, the transaction does not contain any data that can be used to counterfeit a chip or conduct an unauthorised chip transaction by reusing the data.</p>\n<p>One factor common in all fraud protection schemes, however, is that you need to take as much care as possible in protecting your credit card by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being vigilant in safeguarding your card</li>\n<li>Immediately notifying your card issuer if you discover the loss, theft or unauthorised use of your card</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like any insurance, if you are reckless with your credit card or do something that increases the risk of fraud, you may invalidate the protection.</p>",,590,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,59.0,259.5

Many credit cards let you obtain airport lounge access using rewards points you&rsquo;ve accrued, while some will grant you direct access, which could potentially save you hundreds of dollars in yearly membership fees. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s important to note that the level of access granted by these credit cards is often limited, with two to four complimentary visits standard across the industry. That said, if you can combine a credit card with airport lounge access with other credit card travel perks like credit card travel insurance and cheap flights you&rsquo;ve earned through the rewards program, then you have the potential to knock hundreds of dollars off the overall cost of your trip. </span></p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of credit cards with airport lounge access?</h3>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re comparing credit cards with airport lounge access, it&rsquo;s important to take the following pros and cons into account, to make sure you&rsquo;ve got the card that&rsquo;s right for you. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Pros </span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Unlock attractive benefits &ndash;</span></strong><span> Generally a credit card with airport lounge access will have all the bells and whistles, and these perks, rewards and bonuses can be an attractive add-on for many travellers who are looking for the right credit card for their trip. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Potential to make big savings &ndash;</span></strong><span> Provided you pay off your card in full each month and can afford to travel often enough, credit cards with airport lounge access can help you save hundreds of dollars. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>A luxurious experience &ndash;</span></strong><span> Airports are generally characterised by how stressful they can be, but travellers with access to the airport lounge enjoy a far different experience, often with free food and drink, and a setting considerably more comfortable than an airport gate. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span>Cons </span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>The premium features don&rsquo;t come cheap &ndash;</span></strong><span> As with any rewards credit cards, credit cards with free airport lounge access often have higher interest rates, which can be a problem if you&rsquo;re not making repayments on time. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Higher fees than regular cards &ndash; </span></strong><span>By the same token, premium credit cards with features like free airport lounge access often come with higher fees than regular credit cards. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Access to the airport lounge is limited &ndash;</span></strong><span> While there will be plenty of places where you can take advantage of your airport lounge access, this credit card benefit is limited to participating airports.

This makes perfect sense when you consider many of those cardholders will also travel and be more inclined to use that card overseas.</p>\n<p>The airport lounges on offer through such cards are either related to specific airlines such as Qantas, Virgin and Emirates, or they offer access to a broader program such as Priority Pass, which allows card-holders to access its own particular network of airport lounges located around the world.</p>\n<h3>Compare the conditions on each offer</h3>\n<p>Like any perk or reward, there are usually conditions associated with the use of the card to ensure you can utilise the airport lounge, so do your research before you decide which one may be best for you.</p>\n<p>Specifically, conditions attached to the cards are likely to vary based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spending amounts</strong> &ndash; some cards will have a minimum amount of money you&rsquo;re required to spend before you can redeem the complimentary lounge pass.</li>\n<li><strong>Member programs</strong> &ndash; enrolling in the airline or lounge network&rsquo;s membership service may be a prerequisite to acquiring the free lounge pass.</li>\n<li><strong>Airport lounge benefits</strong> &ndash; different airport lounges offer a large range of perks and services including food, beverages and even beauty treatments. Depending on the card conditions, you may be able to access just the base services, or all of the above.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Look at all the card features</h3>\n<p>The next step for those considering these cards is to look more closely at everything on offer so that the lure of a free visit in an airport lounge doesn&rsquo;t financially outweigh the more financially important features of the card. You need to look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest rate and fees </strong>&ndash; there may be a special introductory fee or interest rate that comes with the card for the first year, or a fee waiver on balance transfers, but with rates and fees you need to look at what both revert to after that initial period. This is the biggest game-changer on all cards and should always be your first priority.</li>\n<li><strong>Overseas travel costs</strong> &ndash; another thing to consider is the purchase rate and cash advance rate on the card, particularly when making those transactions in another country. You may get a free visit to the airport lounge but if you&rsquo;re overseas and using the card for purchases or withdrawing money from local ATMs, look at the rate and fee attached to both, as they can sometimes be quite hefty.</li>\n<li><strong>Travel insurances</strong> &ndash; these are commonly attached to the same cards and can either be complementary or the offer taken up when you spend a certain amount of money. You need to look at the coverage they provide as well as who is providing the insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Other elements to consider</strong> &ndash; if you&rsquo;re a regular traveller, look at what lounges you&rsquo;ll be able to access around the world and how that will align with your travel plans and habits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having access to a limited amount of airport lounges in countries you&rsquo;re not likely to visit is not providing any real benefit, but when you consider on a global scale there can be a vast difference in the number of airline lounges attached to different carriers and programs, this should be taken into account, along with everything else.</p>\n<p>The sky will certainly continue to be the limit on these types of credit cards, so ensure you compare like for like when you&rsquo;re looking at everything on offer.</p>",,10,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.0,522.0

Don&rsquo;t get stung paying the car rental excess insurance - at least not before you check your credit card policy.</p>\n<p>Many credit card providers offer complimentary excess insurance on rental cars as an added perk.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is car rental excess?</strong></h3>\n<p>Excess is the agreed amount of money that you would be liable for if there was any damage to your rental car during the rental period. The amount of excess can put consumers in a tricky position, tacking on hidden fees and rates to what may have appeared from the outset to be an affordable rental car.</p>\n<p>For example, you may find a rental car rate that you are happy with, only to discover that it includes insurance with a $4,000 excess. This means that you would need to pay $4,000 out of your own pocket to cover the cost of any damage to the rental car.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker - you can reduce your car rental excess, for a price. This means paying more to hire the car in the first place, turning your affordable rate not-so-affordable in a very short space of time.</p>\n<h3><strong>How can my credit card reduce my car rental excess?</strong></h3>\n<p>Many credit cards offer free car rental excess insurance as an added benefit.</p>\n<p>This benefit usually comes bundled with other travel insurance perks, such as lost or stolen personal property, medical and hospital and travel cancellations.</p>\n<h3><strong>What should I look out for in a credit card with rental car excess insurance?</strong></h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that your credit card doesn&rsquo;t automatically cover you for rental car excess. Rather, your credit card provider may offer a complimentary insurance policy that could partially or entirely cover the cost of your car rental excess (should you need it).</p>\n<p>Like all insurance policies, it&rsquo;s important to find out the policy name, and read the product disclosure statement (PDS) before you rely on it. Many of these insurance policies will not cover your car rental excess in certain situations, such as if you violate the terms of the car rental agreement or if the cardholder is not driving the car at the time of the damage or accident.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do I find a credit card with free car rental insurance?</strong></h3>\n<p>When comparing credit cards, look out for phrases such as &ldquo;rental vehicle excess insurance&rdquo;. You should also look out for cards that are marketed as a travel credit card, or advertise travel insurance perks or benefits. Rental car insurance can usually be found bundled into a more comprehensive travel insurance policy, and less often as a standalone perk.</p>\n<p>As with all credit cards, make sure to weigh up the cost of the annual fee and interest rate compared to the perks or benefits before committing. If everything else adds up, you may have found a way to reduce your car rental excess without paying through the nose for it.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

Credit card information and comparison tools can be found on the credit card page.</p>\n<p>For a full overview of the card, click through to the product page.</p>\n<h3>Why do credit cards offer free travel insurance?</h3>\n<p>Credit card providers offer free travel insurance as a perk on reward and travel cards; it also encourages spending on the cards.</p>\n<p>Many credit card providers require that the expenses of the trip be booked on the credit card to fall under the insurance coverage. Furthermore, for insurance on specific items, card providers often require the items to be bought on the card as well.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that credit providers often charge fees on overseas credit card use, so the cost of the &lsquo;free&rsquo; insurance can really add up. The free travel insurance is normally only given for trips under a certain period of time, which means consumers looking to take longer trips need to check the terms and conditions of the coverage before taking advantage of the insurance.</p>\n<h3>What other perks do credit cards offer?</h3>\n<p>Reward cards normally offer a range of perks alongside travel insurance. A common perk on these cards is price and purchase protection.</p>\n<p>Price and purchase protection covers reductions in price after an item has been bought, as well as coverage against loss, theft and accidental damage for a set period of time; normally six months. Another common perk is extended warranty; many credit providers will provide an extension of the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty for items bought on the card. This extra coverage period is normally 12 months, however some cards may offer more.</p>\n<p>It is important for consumers to remember that most of the perks advertised as free very rarely come without costs. The most obvious cost is an annual fee, which is normally higher on reward credit cards than low-rate cards. Using credit cards overseas also comes with its costs; for example, many cards come with currency conversion fees as well as foreign ATM fees.</p>",,880,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,88.0,227.5

But a flexible lifestyle needs flexible finances, and even the most dedicated world traveller must occasionally return home to organise funds for their next trip. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you spend half your life in airport terminals, or daydreaming about overseas adventures while managing your everyday spending budget, frequent flyer credit cards can prove beneficial. By earning you reward points when you book flights and hotels, or even just when you do your everyday shopping, these cards can make valuable discounts available for flying in style. </span></p>\n<p><span>Here&rsquo;s what to look for when choosing a frequent flyer rewards credit card: </span></p>\n<h3><span>Card type</span></h3>\n<p><span>Whether a major bank or specialised lender is managing your credit card&rsquo;s balance and interest, the payment processing will likely be handled by a separate credit provider, with the three most popular of these being Visa, MasterCard and American Express. </span></p>\n<p><span>Visa and MasterCard credit cards are accepted in most countries. These companies do not issue their own credit cards, but instead offer their card services to other lenders. </span></p>\n<p><span>American Express (or Amex) issues its own credit cards, though it also provides card services to some lenders. &nbsp;Amex cards are more likely to have higher interest rates and fees than Visa and Mastercard, and due to the surcharges involved, they may not always be accepted by all merchants in all countries. That said, Amex cards are also more likely to offer higher rewards. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Points per dollar</span></h3>\n<p><span>To earn frequent flyer rewards with your credit card, you&rsquo;ll need to spend money, either by buying flights and accommodation with the partner airline, or by shopping at affiliated retailers. The rate at which you earn these points will depend on your card and the lender providing it, with the number of points you earn being based on the number of dollars you spend. Depending on the reward program, you may earn one or more frequent flyer point per dollar you spend, or need to spend more than one dollar per point. </span></p>\n<p><span>With some credit cards, you don&rsquo;t directly earn frequent flyer points by spending money, but instead earn generic credit card rewards, which you&rsquo;ll need to trade in for frequent flyer points. These rewards may not always trade in at a 1:1 ratio, either &ndash; you may need to earn a larger number of reward points to trade them in for a smaller number of frequent flyer points.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Partners</span></h3>\n<p><span>Frequent flyer credit cards require a lender to manage the money and count the points, and an airline partner to provide the flights and travel rewards. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you prefer to fly with a particular airline, such as Qantas, Virgin or Etihad, check the frequent flyer partners on the available credit cards to find an offer that suits your preferences. </span></p>\n<p><span>Check the terms and conditions of the different frequent flyer deals as well &ndash; some airline partners put limits on where and how their reward points can be earned or used. For example, you may earn frequent flyer point by booking flights with the airline, or by shopping at specific retailers &ndash; make sure you&rsquo;ll get the most value from the reward program.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Annual flights earned</span></h3>\n<p><span>Comparing rates and rewards for different credit cards is all well and good, but sometimes it&rsquo;s useful to have an example of the degree of value offered by different credit cards. </span></p>\n<p><span>With this in mind, RateCity calculates approximately how many flights from Sydney to Melbourne you could take per year on average, using the frequent flyer points earned with a rewards credit card. </span></p>\n<p><span>These figures are estimates only, based on the assumption that you&rsquo;ll be spending $5000 per month using your credit card. The exact number of flights you may earn per year will be determined by your financial situation and how you use your credit card</span></p>\n<h3><span>Annual fee</span></h3>\n<p><span>Just like most other credit cards, frequent flyer cards often involve paying fees to the lender. Because of the additional rewards and benefits offered by frequent flyer credit cards, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for their fees to be somewhat higher than those for more basic credit cards. </span></p>\n<p><span>Compare the listed fees against the benefits being offered by each credit card, and decide whether you feel the fees are worth it. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll want to pay a lower annual fee than the value of the rewards and extras you intend to use, so you&rsquo;ll ultimately break even and come out ahead.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Do I need to fly frequently to earn frequent flyer points?</span></h3>\n<p><span>Despite the name, it IS possible to earn reward points on a frequent flyer credit card without going anywhere near an airport. </span></p>\n<p><span>While you will earn frequent flyer points by booking flights with your card&rsquo;s partner airlines, you can also earn points simply by using your frequent flyer rewards credit card for everyday spending, especially if you shop at partner supermarkets and stores. The more you (responsibly) spend, the more points you earn!</span></p>\n<h3><span>How can you use frequent flyer points?</span></h3>\n<p><span>Did you know that frequent flyer points aren&rsquo;t limited to just being used to buy flights? It&rsquo;s also possible to redeem them for: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Hotel bookings</span></li>\n<li><span>Flight upgrades</span></li>\n<li><span>Baggage upgrades and priority delivery</span></li>\n<li><span>Car hire</span></li>\n<li><span>Extended warranty</span></li>\n<li><span>Travel and medical insurance</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Frequent flyer points aren&rsquo;t just useful for booking flights, but for managing all of your travel-related expenses. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Other rewards</span></h3>\n<p><span>Some frequent flyer reward cards don&rsquo;t just offer you frequent flyer points as credit card rewards, but also provide you with access to exclusive offers, including:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>access to luxury airport lounges</span></li>\n<li><span>complimentary insurance</span></li>\n<li><span>access to invitation-only sporting events and concerts</span></li>\n<li><span>Personal concierge service</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>There may be more benefits than you expected from shopping with your frequent flyer credit card.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Will my reward points expire?</span></h3>\n<p><span>Credit card reward points don&rsquo;t always have a use-by date, but they sometimes do. If you don&rsquo;t claim these hard-earned rewards in time, you could end up losing them!</span></p>\n<p><span>Check the terms and conditions from the different lenders and airline partners to find out if you need to worry about your credit card rewards expiring. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Are there caps on the number of reward points you can earn/save/spend?</span></h3>\n<p><span>While the more you spend with a credit card, the more reward points you earn, there may be limits. Some lender put caps on the number of reward points a cardholder can earn in a month or a year &ndash; once you hit this cap, you won&rsquo;t earn you additional bonus points from any extra money you spend that month or year. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Are there other ways to earn frequent flyer points?</span></h3>\n<p><span>Frequent flyer reward programs aren&rsquo;t just for credit cards &ndash; certain lenders have partnered with airlines to offer frequent flyer rewards with:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Home loans</span></li>\n<li><span>Car loans</span></li>\n<li><span>Personal loans</span></li>\n<li><span>Savings accounts</span></li>\n<li><span>Transaction accounts</span></li>\n<li><span>Insurance</span></li>\n<li><span>Online share trading</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>As long as you keep making your repayments, saving money or spending money (depending on the financial product in question), you can keep earning points towards your next travel adventure.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Membership levels</span></h3>\n<p><span>Some frequent flyer rewards programs include several tiers of membership, similar to Standard, Gold and Platinum credit cards. The longer you&rsquo;ve been with the program, and the more frequent flyer points you&rsquo;ve earned, the higher the membership level you can attain. </span></p>\n<p><span>Higher level members may gain access to additional rewards and offers, or upgrades to their standard rewards. For example, low-level members of a rewards program may have a capped limit on the number of reward points they can earn per month by spending money. Mid-level members may have a higher monthly cap, and high level members may have no cap at all, allowing them to earn as many reward points as the number of dollars they spend.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Disadvantages and risks of frequent flyer credit cards</span></h3>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s important to remember that to get the most value from any rewards credit card, and especially a frequent flyer card, you&rsquo;ll need to regularly spend money. Unless you&rsquo;re in a financial position where you can comfortably afford to spend between $2000 and $5000 per month with your credit card, a frequent flyer credit card could leave you paying higher interest rates and fees without getting many rewards for your trouble.</span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s also important to remember that credit cards offering higher rewards and bonus offers such as frequent flyer points tend to also be the cards with the higher than average interest rates and/or fees. So not only will you need to regularly spend money to earn points, but also regularly pay off your credit card balance and any interest charges that may accrue, to prevent your jetsetting lifestyle from being grounded by debt.</span></p>",,1600,42,232,139,85729,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,8809.55,38.0

And if you particularly like the sound of enjoying the spoils of what the Hilton Hotel chain has to offer, as a result of using your credit card, the Hilton Honors rewards program could be a way of helping you achieve that.</p>\n<p>So how exactly does this program work, in light of other rewards programs?</p>\n<h3>Reward programs in a nutshell</h3>\n<p>All reward programs are based on accumulating rewards points, or benefits you are eligible for as a result of what is considered everyday spending on your card, and the points gained are usually proportionate to the amount you spend.</p>\n<p>You can then redeem the points for a range of rewards which are offered through the program. The type of reward you receive generally comes in four main forms, which may be a cashback, frequent flyer points, merchandise such as fashion items, electronics, homewares, fuel or event tickets, or shopping discounts on any or all of those items.</p>\n<p>Most programs also offer a points-plus-pay option, where you use your points to redeem part of your reward and pay the rest in cash based on pre-set amounts by each program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Generally, credit cards with reward programs attached do attract higher interest rates and fees than cards without reward programs.</p>\n<h3>How does Hilton Honors work?</h3>\n<p>In the case of Hilton Honors Rewards, the program allows you to earn points on everyday purchases, as well as bonus points on purchases made with Hilton Hotels and its partners.</p>\n<p>Those points can then be used in a number of ways to redeem a range of offers through the Hilton Hotel chain and members of its reward program alliance. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you spend a certain amount of money on the attached credit card you can become eligible for an upgrade to the elite levels of Hilton Honors membership which include silver, gold and diamond status. The number of services and benefits you have access to through the reward program increases in line with the elevated membership status.</p>\n<p>Becoming a member of the Hilton Honors Reward program is conditional when applying for any credit cards attached to the program.</p>\n<h3>The program&rsquo;s global reach</h3>\n<p>The program is one of the largest hotel reward programs in the world and provides benefits within the group&rsquo;s hotels, resorts and properties across more than 5,000 different locations and 100 countries, including a network of major cities and the world&rsquo;s most popular holiday and tourist destinations.</p>\n<p>Through Hilton Honors, members also have access to the Hilton portfolio of hotels which includes other leading accommodation brands and properties around the world:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts</li>\n<li>Conrad Hotels and Resorts</li>\n<li>Canopy by Hilton</li>\n<li>Curio &ndash; a collection by Hilton</li>\n<li>DoubleTree by Hilton</li>\n<li>Tapestry Collection by Hilton</li>\n<li>Embassy Suites by Hilton</li>\n<li>Hilton Garden Inn</li>\n<li>Hampton by Hilton</li>\n<li>Tru by Hilton</li>\n<li>Homewood Suites by Hilton</li>\n<li>Home2 Suites by Hilton</li>\n<li>Hilton Grand Vacations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Redeeming your points and points expiry</h3>\n<p>All Hilton Honors bonus points earned are in addition to the points that you earn via the earning style option you select.</p>\n<p>You can check your points balance online at any time and choose your reward option from the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hotels and resorts &ndash; </strong>this includes booking rooms or obtaining upgrades, or using points for special hotel services or meals from any of the Hilton group properties</li>\n<li><strong>Flights and car travel &ndash; </strong>convert your points into miles with participating frequent flyer partners, or car hire with program partners.</li>\n<li><strong>Shopping and dining &ndash; </strong>offers special rewards at the Hilton Honors Shopping Mall through program partners.</li>\n<li><strong>Events &ndash; </strong>apply to use your points to attend special events being held at Hilton properties around the world</li>\n<li><strong>Charitable donations &ndash; </strong>you can also donate points to a range of program charities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your bonus points will not expire, provided you do one of the following within a period of 12 consecutive months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remain a Hilton Honors credit cardholder</li>\n<li>Stay at a hotel or resort within the Hilton portfolio</li>\n<li>Earn Hilton Honors bonus points through any participating program partner</li>\n<li>Purchase Hilton Honors bonus points</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Transferring points</h3>\n<p>You can boost your Hilton Honors rewards balance by transferring points from an eligible travel or&nbsp;<span>frequent flyer program</span>, and Hilton Honors points can also be bought, gifted or transferred between members with annual points limits placed on each transaction.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What should I consider before I apply?</strong></p>\n<p>You need to take into account the following factors when making your decision about choosing a credit card with a reward program:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest rates and fees &ndash;</strong> many reward card providers will offer a $0 annual fee for the first year to new card applicants as well as special interest rates on any balance transfers. However, you need to also look at what that annual fee reverts to beyond the initial period, as well as finding out what the interest rate is on any balance transfers beyond the initial specified period. Read the fine print.</li>\n<li><strong>Cost versus benefit &ndash;</strong> as enticing as any reward card sounds, you do need to weigh up the total annual cost of the purchases you need to make to be eligible for the card&rsquo;s various rewards. If you&rsquo;re spending more than you usually would in a bid to achieve a reward level, you need to determine if the additional financial pressure this puts on you to pay off that amount is actually worth it. Be realistic about whether you are disciplined with money and are able to remain living within your means if you have the card.</li>\n<li><strong>Paying off the balance in full &ndash;</strong> there&rsquo;s no value in having access to the reward program if you can&rsquo;t afford to pay for the items you put on the card in full within the interest-free period. The interest payments can quickly rack up when you consider many cards have revert rates which are commonly around 20 per cent.</li>\n<li><strong>Are the rewards relevant to your lifestyle &ndash;</strong> you need to look at the accommodation, travel and shopping benefits the card offers to determine whether this is a financial equation that makes sense for you, based on your lifestyle. You should have a pre-determined idea of what sort of rewards are right for you and if it will provide an efficient complement to your existing financial platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Compare what else is on offer &ndash;</strong> compare this card against the reward programs offered through partnerships between other leading hotel chains and card providers. Other hotel chains that have reward programs include the Starwood, Marriott, Hyatt, the Ritz Carlton and IHG and all offer different entitlements through their respective properties and partners. You need to compare apples with apples in order to feel comfortable that you&rsquo;ve really done your homework.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you do all your research, you&rsquo;ll then be in a more considered position to determine whether the card and the program will financially suit your needs.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

They can help you keep track of your spending and give you the freedom to make larger purchases, especially if you choose a card with interest-free days. You might be asking yourself a few questions on your search for credit cards with interest-free days.</p>\n<h3>What are interest-free days?</h3>\n<p>Interest-free days refer to the number of days you can purchase goods before being charged interest on those purchases. For example, you may be offered 55 interest-free days, meaning you can use your credit card to make purchases without having to pay it back for up to 55 days.</p>\n<h3>How many interest-free days do you usually get?</h3>\n<p>The number of interest-free days you&rsquo;ll receive can vary from card to card. Typically, the number of interest-free days ranges anywhere from 50-62 days. If you value interest-free days, you might consider choosing a card with over 55 days of interest-free spending.</p>\n<h3>Are there limitations to using credit cards with interest-free days?</h3>\n<p>The benefit of more interest-free days typically comes with a few conditions. For example, some credit cards will take away your interest-free days if you don&rsquo;t pay your balance by the due date on your statement. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that your interest-free days align with your payment cycle rather than the purchase date. This means that not every purchase you make will be interest-free for the full interest-free period.</p>\n<h3>What happens if you don&rsquo;t pay your bill during the interest-free days?</h3>\n<p>After your interest-free period expires, the purchases that you haven&rsquo;t yet paid off will begin to charge interest. If you tend to pay your bill in full each month, you might not worry about racking up interest charges. However, if you don&rsquo;t usually pay your bill in full and on time, you could end up paying interest each month.</p>\n<h3>How do you find a credit card with interest-free days?</h3>\n<p>Many credit card providers offer interest-free days as a benefit of choosing their card. It&rsquo;s great to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards"">compare credit cards with interest-free days</a> before making your choice. When comparing, don&rsquo;t forget to check for any fees that might accompany the card.</p>\n<h3>What fees do credit cards charge?</h3>\n<p>A few common fees are an annual fee, late payment fee and foreign transaction fee. Annual fees vary, with some cards charging a few hundred dollars and others charging nothing at all. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards/no-annual-fee"">Credit cards with no annual fee</a> don&rsquo;t charge for the convenience of having your card but might not provide the same benefits as cards with higher annual charges.</p>\n<p>Most credit cards have a fee for late payments. This charge will be added if you can&rsquo;t pay or forget to pay your bill. These fees can range from $0 to upwards of $30, so you might want to check the late payment fee before you choose a credit card.</p>\n<p>Foreign transaction fees might be added to your purchases when shopping overseas. If you&rsquo;re an avid traveller, consider searching for a card without a foreign transaction fee.</p>",,40,0,8,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,5.2,409.5

Temporary residents don't make the cut.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal age:</strong> You must be 18 years or older to be eligible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Credit rating:</strong> You must have a good credit rating to qualify for a Jetstar credit card. Your card limits will be based on your financial status.</p>\n<h3><strong>Where does Jetstar fly to?</strong></h3>\n<p>Jetstar services up to 20 domestic centres and also flies to overseas destinations like Indonesia, Honolulu, New Zealand, Singapore, Macau, Japan, Myanmar, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Vietnam.

There are credit cards on the market that waive this fee, and for the well-travelled big-spender this can translate into substantial savings. As the use of personal cheques declines in the evolving Australian payments system, it pays to shop around and be armed with a credit card that suits your needs and budget.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

There are a variety of transactions that can be made through a credit card, which is why the interest rates vary for each one.</p>\n<p>The main interest rate is what is charged on the items you purchase. Cash advance interest is when you withdraw cash or make money transfers from your card. A balance transfer interest is charged when you transfer a balance from one bank&rsquo;s credit card to another. A promotional or introductory interest rate are special interest rates which all you to have a lower interest rate on your card for a limited period of time.</p>\n<h3>Do credit cards with low interest rates on purchases even exist?</h3>\n<p>Credit cards with low interest rates on purchases do exist, but the time period specified varies from one credit card to another.</p>\n<p>For example, some cards have an introductory period of 13 months during which they offer an interest rate of 0 per cent p.a. (per annum). This means that you can purchase items with that credit card without the usual interest rates for 13 months, as specified.</p>\n<p>After the specified time period passes, the credit company will charge you the usual interest rate that they hold for the particular card.</p>\n<p>Many banks offer credit cards with low interest rates (or no interest) for special introductory periods. In fact, some credit card companies offer more than just 12 or 13 months of low interest rates. Some go as far as 18 or even 24 months.</p>\n<h3>Why would banks offer this? Is there a catch?</h3>\n<p>Both big and small Australian banks have decided to offer these introductory low-interest periods in order to lure customers from their rivals.</p>\n<p>Given the incentive that comes in the form of low interest rates offered within a limited time frame, customers will feel more at ease and confident in using their credit cards in their everyday transactions.</p>\n<p>Aside from this, banks also offer lower interest rates on purchases in order to effectively sell a particular credit card to their potential customers. As more and more banks continue to do this, there is more competition in which credit card company gets to offer the best deal. This is why some banks go as far as to offer lower interest rates up until, say, 18 or even 24 months, whereas some banks would only offer a 12-month or six-month time period.</p>\n<h3>Where to find and compare credit cards with low interest rates</h3>\n<p>Many websites readily provide charts that show customers the differences and pros or cons of getting this credit card or that.</p>\n<p>It isn&rsquo;t hard to find lower interest rates offers. Many Australian banks offer low-interest credit card purchases, and provide explanatory information that is accessible on their websites.</p>\n<p>There are many options to choose from, given that there are several dozen lenders in Australia offer more than 200 credit cards between them.</p>\n<h3>How is credit card interest rate calculated?</h3>\n<p>A credit card interest rate is usually calculated based on the balance that you owe daily &ndash; although many cards offer an interest-free period before this charge kicks in. This is why people are often advised to pay off their entire credit card bill each month; by doing so, you can avoid being charged interest.</p>\n<p>Credit card interest rates also depend on the kind of card you get, whether it is a standard card, gold or platinum. Platinum cards have some of the highest interest rates in the market, as well as rewards credit cards.</p>\n<h3>Things to consider before getting a credit card</h3>\n<p>Some credit card companies charge on purchases because sometimes customers fail to pay off their full closing balance on their last statement before the due date stated. If a customer does not pay off the balance before the specified time frame, they will not receive what is called the &ldquo;interest-free&rdquo; days on their card. Interest-free days are sometimes offered by credit companies, but others continue to charge interest on all purchases regardless.</p>\n<p>Having an outstanding balance on your credit card could also mean that you will lose interest-free privileges on your card.</p>\n<h3>Pros and cons of getting a credit card</h3>\n<p>Owning a credit card means more purchasing options. Transactions can be done online or on the phone. When making purchases in person, you won&rsquo;t have to go through your wallet or write a cheque&mdash;all you have to do is swipe.</p>\n<p>You can also opt to pay in installments, which comes in handy especially if you&rsquo;re making a big purchase, such as a car. Many like to have credit card for emergency purposes, like in the event that you have to pay for something you cannot afford at the moment.</p>\n<p>All of this also has a downside. Credit cards could lead to overspending, which could lead you into debt if you&rsquo;re not careful. The fees and interest rates that come along with it can also cost you hundreds of dollars every year.</p>",,160,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,16.0,345.5

Low-rate credit cards are designed to make this process a little easier, offering interest rates that are lower than those dished out by the competition. </span></p>\n<p><span>This makes credit cards with low interest rates theoretically easier to manage, especially for those on tight budgets, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re right for everyone. </span></p>\n<p><span>We&rsquo;re going to look at low-rate credit cards, and the pros and cons of these financial products, so you can determine whether a credit card with a low interest rate is right for you. </span></p>\n<h3>What is credit card interest?</h3>\n<p><span>When you borrow money from a credit provider, you&rsquo;re charged interest on the amount of funds you have used (assuming you don&rsquo;t repay the debt during any interest-free period). This is credit card interest. Think of credit card interest as the cost you pay the credit card holder for the right to borrow the funds. Different credit cards have different credit card interest rates, and this should be something you consider when determining which is the best credit card for you. When you add up credit interest with additional fees and charges, it&rsquo;s easy to see how quickly people can find themselves in financial trouble when choosing the wrong credit card.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<h3>How is credit card interest calculated?</h3>\n<p><span>Credit card interest is charged each day on the amount of debt you owe &ndash; assuming that you&rsquo;re not in an interest-free period.</span></p>\n<p><span>Most credit cards offer an interest-free period, which usually begins not on the day you make a purchase but on the first day of a statement cycle. For example, imagine your credit card has an interest-free period of 55 days; and imagine your statement cycle begins on April 1; and imagine you make a purchase with your credit card on April 10. In that case, the 55-day interest period for that purchase would begin not only April 10 but on April 1. So for that specific purchase, your interest-free period would be only 46 days. </span></p>\n<p><span>Low-rate credit cards are theoretically easier to manage as they offer people seeking credit lower interest rates on repayments, which can potentially make managing your credit budget much easier. </span></p>\n<h3>What are the different types of credit card interest?</h3>\n<p><span>If you are in the market for a credit card with low interest rates, it&rsquo;s important to understand the different types of credit card interest that typically come as part of your card. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Purchase rates &ndash;</span></strong><span> These are the interest rates that are incurred when you make everyday transactions like buying your groceries or paying for a bill online. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Cash advance rates &ndash;</span></strong><span> This is the amount of interest you&rsquo;re charged on any cash transactions. When withdrawing cash from an ATM or supermarket checkout, purchasing foreign currency or performing international money transfers, you may be slugged a cash advance rate. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Promotional and introductory rates &ndash;</span></strong><span> Many credit card providers offer promotional and introductory rates as an incentive for signing on. These credit card rates are generally lower for a limited amount of time, before eventually reverting to the usual (higher) rate. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Balance transfer rates &ndash;</span></strong><span> This is the rate of interest you&rsquo;re charged by the credit card provider when you perform a balance transfer from one credit card to another.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How is a low-rate credit card different from other credit cards?</h3>\n<p><span>As the name would suggest, a low-rate credit cards are credit card that offer consumers lower interest rates than the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span>Low-interest-rate credit cards are generally seen as no-frills products on the credit card market, as they typically do not have the bells and whistles of other products in terms of perks and bonuses. But due to their comparatively lower interest rate, they&rsquo;re theoretically easier to manage. </span></p>\n<p><span>One thing to consider before signing on the dotted line however is what the lower interest rate applies to. The low interest rate may only refer to the credit card&rsquo;s purchase rate, and it is possible to have a credit card with a low purchase rate but a high cash advance rate, for example. This is why you must be careful to read the fine print when comparing low-rate credit cards. </span></p>\n<h3>What should I look for when choosing a low-rate credit card?</h3>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re in the market for a new low-rate credit card, there are many factors you should consider to ensure you&rsquo;ve got the right credit card for your lifestyle, needs and budget. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>What is the purchase rate? &ndash;</span></strong><span> This is ultimately the figure that is going to determine whether your low-rate credit card is a good deal. If you&rsquo;re going to use your low-interest credit card for everyday purchases, generally the lower the purchase rate, the better. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>What fees will I have to pay? &ndash;</span></strong><span> When comparing low-rate credit cards, another factor you must consider is the fees. Credit cards typically have annual fees, administration fees and late fees that are incurred when you miss your payments. These fees can quickly spiral out of control, potentially negating the benefits of the low-rate credit card you&rsquo;ve selected. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Does the card come with any perks? &ndash;</span></strong><span> Low-rate credit cards typically don&rsquo;t have as many perks and bonuses for members as credit cards with higher interest rates. But the credit card rewards offered by your low-rate credit card is still something that should be considered when determining which low-interest-rate credit card is the one for you. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Is the low interest rate fixed? &ndash;</span></strong><span> Another important factor to consider is the permanence of the rate. If your low interest rate is part of a promotion or introductory offer, after a set period of time your credit card will revert to a higher interest rate which could potentially make the credit card a less attractive prospect for some consumers. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of low-rate credit cards?</h3>\n<p><span>Low-rate credit cards can be a good fit for some consumers, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re always the right choice. Here are some of the pros and cons of low-rate credit cards:</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Pros </span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>You can lower your interest repayments &ndash;</span></strong><span> One of the biggest advantages of a credit card with a low interest rate is you will have lower monthly interest payments than if you had a higher-rate card. Low-interest-rate credit cards can offer interest that is significantly lower than competitors, leading to potentially large savings. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>You can potentially reduce your credit card debt &ndash; </span></strong><span>Transferring your credit card debt to a low-interest card can be an effective way to manage credit card debt in some situations, as you will save by not having to pay the higher interest rate of your other card. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span>Cons </span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>They don&rsquo;t have the perks of other credit cards &ndash;</span></strong><span> Low-interest credit cards generally offer fewer rewards and perks than higher-rate cards. This can be a turn-off for people who are looking for fringe benefits. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Balance transfer fees &ndash;</span></strong><span> Many low-interest credit cards have significant balance transfer fees, which is something to be aware of if you&rsquo;re looking to transfer your credit card debt to a credit card with a lower interest rate.</span></li>\n</ul>",,2400,1049,4538,4389,361933,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,38296.850000000006,12.0

Credit cards with Malaysian Airline points offer Enrich Miles when you make purchases on your card.</p>\n<h3>What are credit card rewards?</h3>\n<p>Credit card rewards are incentives a credit card holder receives as they spend money with their card. These rewards might come in the form of cash, airline points, merchandise or other offers. You&rsquo;ll typically receive more rewards when you spend more money on your credit card.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of credit card rewards?</h3>\n<p>Like most benefits, rewards can also have their drawbacks. The biggest pro of credit card rewards are the rewards themselves. Credit card rewards ensure you get something in return for spending your money. This is especially beneficial for people who tend to spend a lot of money with their credit card, as they&rsquo;ll receive extra benefits.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, credit card rewards also have a downside. Because you receive something of value, whether it&rsquo;s airline points or cash, these credit cards tend to have higher annual fees. While it&rsquo;s possible to find <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards/no-annual-fee"">credit cards with no annual fee</a>, rewards credit cards may charge you up to a few hundred dollars a year.</p>\n<p>When searching for a credit card with rewards, you&rsquo;ll want to pay attention to any conditions within the rewards program. You might also find that rewards are capped at a certain amount or that they are difficult to redeem.</p>\n<h3>What are Malaysian Airlines points?</h3>\n<p>Malaysian Airlines offers an incentive program called Enrich. Members of Enrich are able to collect Malaysian Airlines points (or &lsquo;Enrich Miles&rsquo;), which can be used to book discounted flights on Malaysian Airlines and their One World Alliance airline partners. Members can also use their Enrich points for free excess baggage or access into airport lounges.</p>\n<h3>How do you earn Malaysian Airlines points?</h3>\n<p>Malaysian Airlines points can be earned in a number of ways. One of these ways is to spend money using a credit card with Malaysian Airlines points. There are several cards that can earn you Malaysian Airlines miles, such as an American Express credit card. The American Express card will reward you with Membership Rewards Points, which can be converted into Malaysian Airlines points.</p>\n<p>Other ways to earn airline miles include booking flights with Malaysian Airlines and its airline partners, renting a car through certain rental companies, staying with partner hotels and using in-flight shopping. Together, these methods will earn you more Malaysian Airlines points faster.</p>\n<h3>How do you spend Malaysian Airlines points?</h3>\n<p>After you earn Malaysian Airlines points, you can spend them to aid in your travel journey. One of the most common ways to spend airline points is to use them when booking flights. Enough Malaysian Airlines points will mean an airfare at a discounted price.</p>\n<p>While you can use your Enrich miles to book flights with Malaysian Airlines, you can also choose to book through any of their airline partners. Airlines such as British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia create partnerships with Malaysian Airlines in order to give customers more choice.</p>\n<h3>Do Enrich Miles expire?</h3>\n<p>As with most travel miles, Enrich Miles don&rsquo;t last indefinitely. Points must be used within a certain amount of time or they&rsquo;ll be withdrawn from your account. Because of these time limits, people who don&rsquo;t travel often might want to consider signing up for a credit card that offers different forms of rewards.</p>\n<h3>Can Enrich Miles be transferred?</h3>\n<p>Malaysian Airlines allows points to be transferred to your loved ones, but there are conditions. Some of these conditions relate to your Enrich status. Enrich members with a higher status, such as Enrich Gold and Enrich Platinum, will have more flexibility than members with lower rank. Enrich members can move up in status as they earn and fly more.</p>\n<h3>What are some routes Malaysian Airlines flies?</h3>\n<p>Malaysian Airlines is headquartered at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia, but their flight routes can take you across Asia, the South Pacific and into the United Kingdom. South Pacific destinations include Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia and Auckland in New Zealand.</p>\n<p>You might consider a credit card with Malaysian Airlines points if you frequently travel to countries like Thailand, China, Japan and India. Malaysian Airlines offers several flights across dozens of cities in Asia. Travellers to Asia will be able to catch flights to large hubs like Hong Kong and smaller airports like Sibu.</p>\n<h3>What other airlines have credit card rewards?</h3>\n<p>Many airlines choose to offer credit cards so that their customers can earn discounts on flights. You&rsquo;ll find that most large international airlines like Qantas and Qatar Airways have credit cards with points rewards.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure where to start, consider checking with an Australian carrier, as they&rsquo;ll offer flights from an airport near you.</p>\n<h3>What other products/services can you get with credit card rewards?</h3>\n<p>Credit card rewards aren&rsquo;t limited to airline points. While frequent travellers might prefer airline benefits, those who don&rsquo;t travel often may seek other rewards. One of the most popular choices when it comes to credit card benefits is receiving cash back. Cashback benefits will return a percentage of your spending to you. Many credit card holders find this to be a great choice because it doesn&rsquo;t limit how you can spend the money you&rsquo;ve been paid back. It may even help you pay off your credit card bill.</p>\n<p>Another common form of reward is earning points with your credit card provider. You&rsquo;ll typically earn a certain number of points per dollar spent. These points can then be redeemed to purchase goods or services. Shopping rewards may turn these points into discounts or vouchers that can be used to make purchases.</p>\n<h3>How should you choose which credit card rewards are right for you?</h3>\n<p>Credit card rewards come in a variety of forms, so it can be a challenge to choose the right reward program for you. You might consider looking at your current spending and travel habits. If you are a frequent traveller for business or leisure, it might be worth having a credit card with airline benefits so that your travelling can be cheaper and more comfortable. However, if you don&rsquo;t travel often but enjoy shopping, a card with shopping benefits might be a better fit for you.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re likely to forget to use points or you&rsquo;d rather pay less in the first place, you may want to consider a credit card with fewer rewards, but also lower fees. By choosing a card with little to no annual fee, you&rsquo;ll retain more of your money from the start.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

Top-tier Marriott rewards members can also unlock free breakfasts, hotel lounge access and frequent flyer benefits. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Lower rates &ndash;</span></strong><span> Travellers who are part of the Marriott Rewards program also have exclusive access to lower hotel rates when staying at participating venues. These rates generally can be accessed when you book directly with Marriott, or through approved travel professionals. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Additional perks &ndash;</span></strong><span> If you have a Marriott Rewards credit card you also have access to a range of additional bonuses, like exclusive travel rewards programs, gift cards at a range of major retailers and brands, select travel packages and priority pass options. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How do you earn Marriott Rewards points?</h3>\n<p><span>Credit card holders who are part of the Marriott Rewards program have a range of ways to earn Marriott Rewards points and unlock the benefits of this credit card rewards scheme:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Stay at a Marriott-branded hotel &ndash;</span></strong><span> Marriott Rewards scheme members get points for staying at Marriott-branded hotels and participating Ritz-Carlton locations around the world. The amount of points you earn depends on where you&rsquo;re staying and the sort of accommodation you&rsquo;ve booked at the participating hotel. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Make purchases at Marriott Rewards partners &ndash;</span></strong><span> The Marriott Rewards scheme has a range of partners which can provide a useful way to accumulate more points. Making purchases through travel companies like Hertz and CruisesOnly can be a quick way to accumulate more points and get you closer to the credit card rewards schemes benefits. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Book events with a Marriott-branded hotel &ndash;</span></strong><span> Booking an event with a credit card that&rsquo;s part of the Marriott Reward scheme can also be a way to earn points quickly. This can be useful for business travellers, or even people planning big events like a wedding reception. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Inviting friends to join &ndash;</span></strong><span> You can also earn extra Marriott Rewards points by inviting friends to join up to the scheme, entitling you to a sign-on bonus. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How do you use Marriott Rewards points?</h3>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;ve accumulated enough Marriott Rewards points, you have a range of redemption options to unlock the perks and benefits of this credit card rewards scheme. These include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Free nights &ndash;</span></strong><span> You can use the points accumulated through the Marriott Rewards scheme to book free hotel stays at participating accommodation outlets.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Room upgrades &ndash;</span></strong><span> Points earned through the Marriott Rewards scheme can also be put towards room upgrades for a better view or a larger suite. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Extra perks and bonuses &ndash;</span></strong><span> Marriott Rewards points can also be put towards extra perks and bonuses such as travel experiences, priority treatment and exclusive access. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How long do Marriott Rewards last?</h3>\n<p><span>One important point for anyone who is considering signing up to the Marriott Rewards scheme is the potential for your credit card reward points to expire. And with Marriott Rewards, it really is a case of use your points or lose them. Marriott Rewards expire after 24 months without any qualifying activity. A qualifying activity could be marking a purchase with your Marriott Rewards card, taking a paid stay at one of the participating hotels or redeeming the points on your card.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>\n<h3>Can I transfer my rewards points?</h3>\n<p><span>It is possible to transfer points you&rsquo;ve earned through the Marriott Rewards scheme to other Marriott Rewards members, but there are some strict limitations in place. You can transfer anywhere from 1,000 points to a maximum of 50,000 points per year for a small transaction fee, unless you&rsquo;re a Gold or Platinum Elite member who can transfer points for free. In some cases, if transferring points to satisfy a specific award, you will be able to exceed the 50,000-point limit. </span></p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of credit card reward schemes?</h3>\n<p><span>Before signing up to a credit card that uses the Marriott Rewards scheme, it&rsquo;s useful to acquaint yourself with the general pros and cons of credit card reward schemes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Pros</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Rewards &ndash;</span></strong><span> This is probably a bit of a given, but the perks are the main drawcard of rewards credit cards. These products typically give members exclusive access to perks like merchandise, travel bonuses and cashback discounts off purchases. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Bonus points &ndash;</span></strong><span> Some rewards cards offer bonus points just for signing up. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Tangible savings &ndash;</span></strong><span> If you&rsquo;re loyal to a specific brand represented by the reward scheme, rewards credit cards can help you make tangible savings as a returning customer. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Extras &ndash;</span></strong><span> Rewards credit cards often give you access to extras like travel insurance, cashback offers and exclusive discounts on related products. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span>Cons&nbsp; </span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Incentive to spend &ndash;</span></strong><span> With the promise of more points for spending more money, reward credit cards can sometimes encourage dangerous spending habits. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>High fees and interest rates &ndash;</span></strong><span> Rewards credit cards often have high interest payments and high annual fees. Unless you&rsquo;re paying off your balance in full every month, the incentive of the reward could be nullified by the extra payments you&rsquo;re making. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Restrictions &ndash;</span></strong><span> Another sticking point can be the restrictions on the type of purchases that will allow reward scheme members to earn points, which is why it&rsquo;s important to understand whether the reward credit card will complement your lifestyle. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Point capping and expiry &ndash;</span></strong><span> Many reward-based credit cards have point-capping regulations that restrict the amount of points you can earn in a year, and regulations that have points expire after a certain amount of time. These factors have the potential to undermine the value of your reward credit card.</span></li>\n</ul>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

Perhaps you make a lot of online purchases from overseas retailers and want to stop paying extra?</p>\n<p>Whatever your reason, foreign transaction fees are a frustrating part of overseas transactions. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about credit cards with no foreign transaction fees.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are foreign transaction fees?</strong></h3>\n<p>Foreign transaction fees are an additional amount charged to your credit card when you make a purchase outside of Australia. You will usually notice this as an additional fee of 2 or 3 per cent, depending on your bank and credit card. The purpose, or justification, for this fee is that it covers the cost of the bank and credit card company to process a foreign transaction.</p>\n<h3><strong>Are foreign transaction fees the same as currency conversion fees?</strong></h3>\n<p>No. Foreign transaction fees are charged on transactions that are processed outside Australia. Currency conversion fees are charged in order to convert a foreign currency to Australian dollars.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are shopping with an overseas online retailer and being charged in Australian dollars, you won&rsquo;t be charged a currency conversion fee, but you could be charged a foreign transaction fee. If that same retailer was also charging you in a foreign currency, you could be charged <em>both</em> a foreign transaction fee and a currency conversion fee.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do I avoid paying foreign transaction fees?</strong></h3>\n<p>These fees apply not only to credit cards, but bank accounts too. It&rsquo;s unlikely that your bank account has no foreign transaction fees, so if you want to avoid paying extra on your overseas purchases, you can shop around for a credit card that waives these fees.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do I find a credit card with no foreign transaction fees?</strong></h3>\n<p>When searching for a credit card of this type, it&rsquo;s best to look out for credit cards with &ldquo;no overseas charges&rdquo; or &ldquo;no international fees&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Credit cards with no foreign transaction fees will usually come bundled with other travel rewards, such as low or no currency conversion fees and overseas ATM charges. These credit cards are designed to appeal to consumers as a &lsquo;travel credit card&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>You will need to read the fine print when comparing credit cards, to make sure that they actually do not charge a foreign transaction fee. Even credit cards without foreign transaction fees can have other, hidden, fees for overseas purchases, such as currency conversions and ATM withdrawals.</p>\n<h3><strong>Is a credit card with no foreign transaction fees right for me?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you frequently make purchases from overseas retailers &ndash; whether due to travel, or online shopping &ndash; it&rsquo;s always a good idea to keep your fees as low as possible. But make sure that the credit card you choose won&rsquo;t also be charging you hidden fees for currency conversions or ATM withdrawals. These fees could easily cancel out any savings you&rsquo;ve made from avoiding foreign transaction fees.</p>\n<p>As with all credit cards, make sure that you can also afford (or justify) the annual fee and the interest rate. If everything adds up, you may have just found a credit card that could help you save.</p>",,20,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2.0,473.5

When you&rsquo;re withdrawing money frequently, paying a fee with every transaction can quickly add up.</p>\n<p>There are some providers that offer credit cards with no overseas ATM fees, although other charges may still apply when you use your credit card at an ATM in a foreign country.</p>\n<h3>What fees are charged to use a credit card at an overseas ATM?</h3>\n<p>There are a number of fees and added costs to consider when taking money out at an overseas ATM using a credit card:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Foreign transaction fee</strong> &ndash; Most credit card companies charge a fee that equals a percentage of transactions made in an international currency. For example, if you withdraw $300 at an overseas ATM, you could be charged a fee of $9 (or 3 per cent). This fee can be avoided by choosing a credit with no foreign transaction fees.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cash advance fee</strong> &ndash; This fee is charged by your provider when you use your credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM or for any other &lsquo;cash advance&rsquo; transaction, such as purchasing foreign currency. The cash advance fee is also a percentage of the total transaction amount.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cash advance interest</strong> <strong>rate</strong> &ndash; If you use your credit card to take out money at an ATM overseas (or in Australia), a cash advance interest rate will apply. This is usually higher than the standard purchase rate, which means you&rsquo;ll be paying more interest on debt accrued from ATM withdrawals.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Foreign ATM charges</strong> &ndash; Many foreign banks and ATM companies also charge a fee for withdrawing money at their ATMs.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Factors to consider for overseas credit card use</h3>\n<p>As well as the fees that come with overseas ATM use, it&rsquo;s worth also considering the following factors when you use your credit card while travelling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Daily limits</strong> &ndash; Banks and providers put a cap on how much money you can withdraw each day, so check your limit before travelling to make sure you&rsquo;ll be able to access enough money each day.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exchange rates</strong> &ndash; These can fluctuate daily and have a significant impact on how much you&rsquo;re spending and the total cost of fees.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rewards</strong> - If you use a rewards credit card at an overseas ATM, you may not earn points on the transaction if cash advances aren&rsquo;t considered an &lsquo;eligible purchase&rsquo; by your provider.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Alternatives to overseas credit card ATM withdrawals</h3>\n<p>Although some companies offer credit cards with no overseas withdrawal fees or foreign transaction fees, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll still be hit with other cash advance fees or ATM charges.</p>\n<p>There are a number of other options for spending overseas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prepaid debit cards</strong> &ndash; You can load money onto a prepaid card before leaving. This allows you to lock in an exchange rate, and because it&rsquo;s your own money, you won&rsquo;t be charged interest or cash advance fees.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Foreign currency</strong> &ndash; Avoid card fees by getting cash in the local currency from a foreign currency outlet overseas or in Australia.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Travellers&rsquo; cheques</strong> &ndash; These can be used as an alternative to cards or cash in some overseas locations, but aren&rsquo;t accepted by all merchants.</li>\n</ul>",,390,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,39.0,283.0

When you&rsquo;re overseas and running short on cash, a credit card can offer a flexible means to manage your finances over the course of your adventure.</span></p>\n<p><span>But not every credit card is an ideal overseas travel companion. Some cause as many problems as they solve, making them the financial equivalent of that stranger from the hostel who insists they know a shortcut, but ends up getting you completely lost in an unfamiliar city. </span></p>\n<p><span>To help you find a credit card that&rsquo;s a good travel companion &ndash; the financial equivalent of the friend with the map, the phrasebook, and the endless enthusiasm for cheesy selfies in front of historic monuments &ndash; here are some of the features to look out for:</span></p>\n<h3><span>International acceptance</span></h3>\n<p><span>First thing&rsquo;s first &ndash; is your credit card going to be accepted in the countries where you plan to travel? Most major credit cards are accepted around much of the world, but it&rsquo;s often worth quickly double-checking that yours will be accepted at your destination, to avoid a very awkward and embarrassing inconvenience. </span></p>\n<p><span>Generally, Visa and Mastercard credit cards can be used in all but a handful of countries around the world, with few barriers or restrictions on their usage. American Express cards are also widely accepted in most countries, though additional surcharges may apply, so not all merchants will always accept them. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Currency conversion fees</span></h3>\n<p><span>Depending on how the Aussie dollar is doing at any given time, travelling through certain parts of the world could leave you feeling like a rock star as you flash fat stacks of the local cash, or incredibly depressed when a cup of coffee costs the equivalent of a complete breakfast back home. </span></p>\n<p><span>However the global currency market is treating you, using your credit card overseas could end up costing you extra. Some credit card providers charge a fee to cover the administration costs of currency conversion &ndash; typically 0-5% of the transaction price. </span></p>\n<p><span>These currency conversion charges are separate to the foreign transaction fees that some lenders also charge for overseas purchases made from Australia, such as online shopping. </span></p>\n<p><span>Whether you plan to spend up big while overseas, or carefully stick to a pre-planned budget, it&rsquo;s worth keeping these extra costs in mind. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Overseas ATM charges</span></h3>\n<p><span>There are many spots around the world where slapping down the plastic isn&rsquo;t a payment option, such as bartering in a market or catching a pedal taxi. &nbsp;In these cases, you&rsquo;ll need to get your hands on some of the folding stuff. If your bank account is already looking a bit sparse, you may need to consider visiting the ATM and using your credit card to make a cash advance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Even at home, credit card cash advances have higher than average interest rates compared to regular credit card purchases, and no interest-free period, so getting cash out with your credit card will often cost you more than you expected. And this is before you take into account any additional fees your credit card provider may charge for accessing overseas ATMs. If your lender charges an overseas withdrawal fee on your credit card, it may be a percentage cost based on your withdrawal amount, a fixed fee per withdrawal, or whichever is higher. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Travel insurance</span></h3>\n<p><span>Travel insurance is an important safety net for any overseas adventure. If your flights are cancelled abruptly, if you experience a medical emergency, or if you run into other trouble while on the road, it&rsquo;s reassuring to know that you&rsquo;ll have means available to get out of this jam.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some credit cards offer free travel insurance as a bonus feature, though there are typically terms and conditions involved. Check with your lender to find out what&rsquo;s required &ndash; for example, it&rsquo;s not uncommon that you&rsquo;ll need to at least purchase your flights, if not your accommodation and pre-booked activities too, using your credit card in order to activate the free travel insurance for your trip.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Rewards and frequent flyer points</span></h3>\n<p><span>We all have that one friend who caught the travel bug (as in &ldquo;deep sense of wanderlust&rdquo;, not &ldquo;exotic stomach flu&rdquo;) on their first trip overseas. If they&rsquo;re not currently setting out on a trip, or coming home from one, they&rsquo;re busy planning their next adventure. If you don&rsquo;t have this one friend, then you probably ARE that one friend. </span></p>\n<p><span>Frequent overseas travellers may enjoy the benefits offered by credit card reward programs, especially if these rewards include frequent flyer points that can go towards future travel! That said, credit cards with extensive rewards programs are more likely to have higher interest rates than simpler credit cards that just offer the basics. Unless you&rsquo;re able to quickly clear your credit card balance each time you book flights and accommodation, you could be looking at some hefty interest charges. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Security</span></h3>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s always important to feel confident that your credit card provider is protecting your finances and personal information, but especially when you&rsquo;re travelling overseas. Credit cards can be stolen, skimmed, cloned and used fraudulently, so it&rsquo;s worth contacting your lender to find out what to do if you suspect that some villain has access to your credit card details. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders and credit card providers offer overseas support, such as access to emergency replacement cards or cardless cash advances while overseas, which can be a huge help when you&rsquo;re away from home and need access to your finances. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Credit Card Travel Tips: </span></h3>\n<h4><span>Consider prepaid travel cards</span></h4>\n<p><span>If you or a loved one could really use some convenient access to travel funds, but would prefer to avoid some of the financial risks of a credit card, then pre-paid travel cards could be worth considering. </span></p>\n<p><span>These cards work a bit like the gift cards from supermarkets and department stores, in that they can be loaded up with a fixed amount of cash to be spent how you choose, except they&rsquo;re not restricted to being used in just the one store, and instead can be used anywhere that credit cards are accepted. Plus, because they provide a flexible way to spend their pre-loaded balance, rather than a means to borrow money, a prepaid travel card means you&rsquo;re far less likely to end up in debt at the end of your overseas trip. </span></p>\n<h4><span>Tell your lender</span></h4>\n<p><span>More than one traveller has been surprised to find their credit card being declined following their first overseas transaction. This may be because your bank or lender is doing its job too well, and assuming that the international use of your card is an attempt at fraud by some nefarious criminal-type. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s worth contacting your lender before you travel, and letting them know the dates when you plan on taking your credit card overseas. Make sure they also know your destination &ndash; for example, if your lender knows that you&rsquo;re backpacking though Nepal, their alarm bells won&rsquo;t go off if your credit cared is used to book accommodation in the Himalayas, but they&rsquo;ll spring into action if your card is used at an electronics store in the rural United States. </span></p>\n<h4><span>Save your receipts</span></h4>\n<p><span>Business travellers are well aware of the importance of collecting receipts for any money spent while on the road &ndash; the accounts department won&rsquo;t reimburse you without them! But even those of us who aren&rsquo;t travelling on the company expense account may find it worthwhile to save our receipts when travelling overseas. </span></p>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;re back home from your trip, you can put all of your receipts together, compare them to your credit card statement, and double-check all of the figures involved, including any fees and currency conversion charges. From here, you can work out just how much extra it cost to use your credit card on your trip, and have a think about whether this extra convenience was ultimately worth it, and whether you need to start considering alternative credit card options. </span></p>\n<h4><span>Add funds before you travel!</span></h4>\n<p><span>One neat tip that some overseas travellers find useful is to pay money onto your credit card BEFORE you head overseas, rather than afterwards. Not just paying off your credit card so there&rsquo;s zero balance owing, but putting your credit card so far into the black that you have a surplus available. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re in a position where you can afford to get ahead on your credit card like this before heading off on a trip, this extra financial buffer can allow you to make more use of your card while overseas and end up in less debt at the end of the trip. A smaller debt can be paid off more quickly and easily than a large debt, which should mean fewer interest charges as a result! </span></p>",,170,36,391,378,62828,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,6433.150000000001,42.0

These benefits can include reduced booking fees, priority seating and other inflight perks.</p>\n<h3>How do you find credit cards with&nbsp;partner discounts?</h3>\n<p>RateCity provides product information on many of Australia&rsquo;s major banks and credit lenders.

A list of credit card partners should also be available on credit card providers&rsquo; websites.</p>\n<h3>Why do credit cards offer&nbsp;partner discounts?</h3>\n<p>Credit cards offer partner discounts as a way of giving customers extra value with their cards. A customer who travels a lot may be tempted by a card that offers partner discounts on flights, hotel rooms and car hire. These discounts do not come without their costs, so it is important to check the credit card&rsquo;s annual fee before applying.</p>\n<p>Credit cards also offer partner discounts as a way of incentivising spending on the card. It is common for customers to have to present and use the credit card to receive the partner discount. When a credit provider can offer a wide variety of partner discounts, it becomes a good way to encourage spending on the card.</p>\n<p>It is important that consumers consider how beneficial partner discounts will be before applying for the card. Often these cards can come with higher annual fees and higher interest rates.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of&nbsp;credit cards with&nbsp;partner discounts?</h3>\n<p>A positive aspect of credit card partner discounts is that they can help cardholders save money on services they were already planning to purchase. Many cards provide partner discounts for practical services that are easy for the average consumer to take advantage of, such as airline tickets, car hire and hotel room bookings.</p>\n<p>A downside of credit card partner discounts is that they encourage consumer spending, sometimes on non-essential items or on items consumers were not planning to buy. In situations like these, consumers are not actually saving money, they are just spending money to obtain the discounts &ndash; in effect, &lsquo;buying&rsquo; discounts. As well as this, even though partner discounts are advertised as free perks, cardholders are usually paying for these perks in the form of a higher annual fee.</p>\n<h3>What other perks do credit cards offer?</h3>\n<p>Other perks available on credit cards include free travel insurance, bonus points, extended warranty, and accidental damage and theft cover.</p>\n<p>Much like cards that provide partner discounts, these added benefits are usually paid for in the form of a higher annual fee compared with basic low-rate cards without the frills.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

You may not know about a lesser-known perk called price protection.</p>\n<p>Credit cards that offer a price protection guarantee to protect the cardholder from overpaying or getting ripped off. For example &ndash; you purchase a product in-store and pay $1,000 for it. A few days later, you notice another store selling the same item for a lower price than you originally paid. If you&rsquo;ve got a credit card with price protection guarantee, you would theoretically be able to claim the difference between what you paid and the lower price.</p>\n<p>Before you start backtracking through your credit card statement, here&rsquo;s what you need to know about credit cards with price protection guarantee.</p>\n<h3>How do credit cards with price protection guarantee work?</h3>\n<p>Generally speaking, a credit card price guarantee is a bonus feature offered by credit card companies to give cardholders peace of mind. Depending on the type of card you choose, the price protection guarantee may be included as part of the card&rsquo;s features, or it may be available at an extra charge.</p>\n<p>The conditions and amount you can claim vary depending on the card, but as a general rule of thumb, a price protection guarantee is usually valid for up to three months for products that have been bought using the card in Australia. Regardless of how often you use your credit card, knowing how to use a credit card with a price protection guarantee can save you from getting ripped off or overpaying.</p>\n<h3>What to look for in credit cards with price protection guarantee</h3>\n<p>The terms and conditions of credit cards offering a price protection guarantee vary greatly between cards, so it&rsquo;s important to do your research and compare your options.</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re comparing price protection guarantee, look out for what items are covered as there are usually limits on what you can and can&rsquo;t claim. For example, a camera or smartphone may be covered, but a car or motorbike may not. Generally speaking, perishable and consumable items aren&rsquo;t eligible. If you&rsquo;re a frequent flyer and use your card overseas, check that the price protection guarantee covers international purchases.</p>\n<p>In addition to offering a price protection guarantee, some credit cards also offer insurance cover against theft, accidental damage or loss for a period of time. Policies and conditions vary between cards, so check the credit card product disclosure statement, so you know where you stand.</p>\n<p>There may also be limits to the amount you can claim &ndash; some cards have a dollar limit per claim while other may have an annual threshold.</p>\n<p>The claims process is different for each card, so find out what happens if you do need to make a claim. There are things to look for, such as whether you need to claim in a specific timeframe, what supporting documentation you need to claim and how long it takes for the claim to be processed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Price protection guarantees are a feature of credit cards. While it can be a beneficial feature, there are other factors to consider when comparing credit cards. It always pays to look at the bigger picture and factor in card fees, interest rates, rewards programs and other incentives like interest-free days. <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards"">Click here to compare</a></span> credit cards with price protection guarantee.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

Purchase protection means that customers are entitled to a refund of certain items they buy using a credit card. Take note, however, that the refund only applies until a certain time period after the purchase is made. This feature is convenient for cases wherein the price often fluctuates, especially in major purchases such as plane flights. By offering purchase protection in a credit card, customers are also encouraged to make the purchase without worrying if the price will drop or not.</p>\n<p>The purchase protection feature is a perk of some credit cards, especially in platinum and gold cards. Standard credit cards may also offer purchase protection, but it may sometimes come with a fee and conditions may vary from one credit card company to another.</p>\n<h3><strong>Conditions</strong></h3>\n<p>The conditions also vary among credit card companies, which is why it is important to read through the terms and conditions of the product coverage before purchasing a credit card.</p>\n<p>A credit card purchase protection will generally apply to selected items. Consumable goods or vehicles are usually excluded from the purchase protection feature. The purchase protection will usually last for up to three months since the date of purchase; however, others can last as long as six months, depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Lastly, take note that there the claim limits of purchase protection usually amount to around $50,000 per year.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Pros</strong></h3>\n<p>The best part of purchase protection is that it ensures that you can get reimbursed &ndash; and that you can report theft or damage immediately. Making the purchase by credit card also ensures that these purchases are tracked and that there is a clear record of it.</p>\n<p>The credit card company and insurance company will take the necessary steps to make sure you get a refund for whatever goes wrong in your purchase.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cons</strong></h3>\n<p>It is important to note that the purchase protection feature is a type of insurance. This means that credit card companies also aim to encourage customers to spend on an item without worrying too much about not getting reimbursed in the event that the item is lost, stolen or damaged.</p>\n<p>That being said, overspending is something to watch out for. It is easier to overspend knowing that your credit card has that safety net that comes in the form of purchase protection.</p>\n<p>Second, there is also a risk that your details will be compromised the more you use your card, so be sure to use it at, say, a major retailer that you trust. Even then, it is always good to think twice before making that credit card swipe.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do I make an insurance claim for a purchase?</strong></h3>\n<p>First, you must contact the insurance company and provide details of the item purchase and proof that it was purchased with your credit card within the time frame specified. Supporting documentation should also be at hand, which includes online or print receipts. If the purchased item was stolen, lost, or damaged, proof of this will be needed, as well.</p>\n<p>It usually takes 14 days to find out if the claim was successful.</p>\n<p>However, take note that the process of making a purchase protection claim also varies, so it is best to check with your credit card company or insurance company first.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

Credit card companies design these to encourage customers to spend more. The more you spend, the more rewards and points you can redeem in the long run.</p>\n<p>These are usually recommended for people who have a steady income and good credit score. It is also good to keep in mind that some credit cards offer different rewards from others, which is why you must do your research and determine which rewards credit card is right for you. This means that the rewards are actually those you plan to use and are suited to your spending habits.</p>\n<p>Rewards are often tied to &lsquo;points&rsquo;, which pile up the more purchases you make. These points can be redeemed by buying certain items, gaining travel perks, discounts and the like.</p>\n<p>It can be beneficial for a frequent shopper to own a rewards credit card, which will enable them to earn more points and reap the benefits and perks in the future.</p>\n<h3>Qantas points &ndash; the basics</h3>\n<p>Many lenders have a Qantas Points feature, such as ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB, Westpac and more.</p>\n<p>Qantas offers a range of points for a customer&rsquo;s everyday banking. You can earn Qantas points through home loans, car loans, eligible insurance premiums, online trading, or even by simply opening a savings account.</p>\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not a frequent flyer, you can still earn a lot of Qantas points on the ground, simply by doing your everyday banking.</p>\n<h3>Qantas points &ndash; more detail</h3>\n<p>There are different Qantas privilege cards with a variety of status credits required to reach, or status credits required to keep the privilege card, as well as other benefits.</p>\n<p>There is the Qantas Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Platinum One.</p>\n<p>To give an overview of the differences and points offered each card, an example would be in the Qantas Silver card in comparison to the Platinum One card.</p>\n<p>In the Qantas Silver card, 300 status credits are required to be able to keep the card, while 3,600 is required under Platinum One. Silver cards also require 250 status credits to be able to keep the card, while the Platinum card still requires the 3,600 status credits.</p>\n<p>Other travel benefits also vary per Qantas privilege card. You can earn Status Bonus Points on both Qantas and Jetstar airlines &ndash; 50 per cent on a Qantas Silver card and 100 per ent on Platinum and Platinum One cards. With American Airlines, a Silver card will get you 25 per cent status bonus points and 100 per cent on both Platinum and Platinum One cards.</p>\n<p>All Qantas privilege cards have priority phone service and preferred seating on flights is also offered to its customers, as well as complimentary seating with Advance Seat Selection. All privilege cards also entitle the customer to preferential access to Qantas Classic Award Seats.</p>\n<p>For more information, check out <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.qantas.com/fflyer/dyn/program/statusPrivileges#travel-benefits"">these privilege card comparison charts</a>.</p>\n<h3>Qantas Points conditions</h3>\n<p>Your Qantas Points will not expire as long as you continue to use these points in your frequent flyer account at least once every 18 months. In the event that your Qantas Points do expire, you are still considered a Qantas Frequent Flyer member. To gain Qantas points again, you can just use your card like always.</p>\n<p>Another bonus is that a portion of your Qantas points can be transferred to an eligible family member, such as immediate family members, but they also have to be Frequent Flyer members in any 12-month period.</p>\n<p>It might be good to do this when other family members need more Qantas points or if your points are about to expire. The family transfers need to be a minimum of 5,000 and a maximum of 600,000 for every transfer. These transfers can be done online or by calling the Frequent Flyer Service Centre.</p>\n<p>You might even get a reward flight for an eligible family member if you use your points this way.</p>\n<h3>Qantas and its routes</h3>\n<p>Qantas is Australia's largest domestic and international airline. Qantas, which was originally called Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited, was founded in 1920 in the Queensland outback.</p>\n<p>Since then, it has built a reputation as one of the leading long-distance airlines in the world.</p>\n<p>Qantas has regular routes within Australia, with many flights to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. It also has regular flights to Johannesburg, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Bali, London, Paris, Barcelona, Dubai, Nadi, Auckland, Queenstown, Los Angeles, New York, Las Vegas, Santiago, Rio de Janeiro and many more cities.</p>\n<h3>The pros of credit card rewards</h3>\n<p>There are many perks to owning a rewards credit card. Some credit cards even offer its customers bonus points the moment you sign up for a particular rewards card, which helps you get a good start on the whole idea of it.</p>\n<p>There is also a great variety of rewards programs, so there will probably be one tailored to the specific benefits that you want. For example, if you like to travel a lot, you might want a credit card with frequent flyer points under a particular airline. If you&rsquo;re a frequent shopper, there might be rewards programs tailored to your shopping preferences, whether that&rsquo;s retail stores or the supermarket.</p>\n<p>The more you purchase items from a specific brand or store, the more points you are likely to rack up. Some even offer loyalty cards, which means that you can, say, get special discounts or a gift card once you have reached a certain amount of points.</p>\n<p>Others also offer cashback rewards, which means that you can use to repay your credit card balance once it is starting to build up. This allows you to manage your spending better.</p>\n<h3>The cons of credit card rewards</h3>\n<p>An obvious downside to getting a rewards credit card would be the danger of overspending or spending more than what is necessary. Since there is an incentive &ndash; a goal, reward, perk &ndash; to reach for, you may feel the need to keep spending for the sake of earning more rewards points. In other words, you might feel pressured to keep up with the rat race. Keep in mind that you will have to repay the balance and ensure you don&rsquo;t accumulate interest &ndash; or else you might find yourself in great debt in the future.</p>\n<p>Take note that interest rates and annual fees are also generally higher on those credit cards than those without rewards programs.</p>\n<p>Rewards programs are also very selective on what items you can or cannot purchase under the points system. There are also a lot of restrictions on how customers can earn and redeem the points they get. Sometimes, these rewards and points only apply to certain companies, brands, or airlines, so watch out for that too.</p>",,12100,0,3,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1210.45,93.0

As well as offering financial flexibility and a simpler means of paying for your shopping, certain credit cards can also make additional rewards available to you, ranging from everyday discounts to exclusive offers. </span></p>\n<p><span>To find a credit card that offers good value on rewards, consider the following:</span></p>\n<h3><span>Card type</span></h3>\n<p><span>While your lender may manage the balances, interest rates and fees for your credit card, the payment processing services will likely be handled by another company entirely, with &nbsp;the three most popular options being Visa, MasterCard and American Express.</span></p>\n<p><span>Visa and MasterCard don&rsquo;t offer their own credit cards, but instead offer their services to lenders around the world. MasterCard and Visa credit cards are available with a wide variety of different interest rates, fees, and reward programs, so you should always check each lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span>American Express (or Amex) offers its own credit cards as well as providing its services to other lenders. Amex cards are more likely to charge higher fees and interest rates than Visa and MasterCard options, and due to their surcharges involved, Amex cards aren&rsquo;t always accepted by all merchants around the world. However, Amex cards are also more likely to offer higher than average credit card rewards, which may make the extra costs worthwhile if you regularly spend money with your credit card. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Points per dollar</span></h3>\n<p><span>The more money you (responsibly!) spend with your rewards credit card, the more reward points you can potentially earn. These points can be redeemed and spent on a variety of different rewards, from retail discounts to exclusive offers. </span></p>\n<p><span>Most rewards credit cards earn you one or more reward points for every dollar you spend, though some earn points at a slower rate, requiring you to spend more than one dollar per reward point you earn. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Value of rewards</span></h3>\n<p><span>Every credit card reward program is slightly different, with a different &ldquo;exchange rate&rdquo; between the points you earn and the regards they can be redeemed for. This can sometimes make the approximate cash value of credit card reward points difficult to calculate. </span></p>\n<p><span>At RateCity, we&rsquo;ve done the hard work for you, by estimating which credit cards offer the greatest value in terms of their reward points per year. </span></p>\n<p><span>We base these figures on an assumption that you&rsquo;ll be spending $5000 per month with your credit card, and that you&rsquo;ll be using the reward points you earn to purchase shopping vouchers from the provider (one of the simplest credit card rewards). &nbsp;We then subtract the card&rsquo;s annual fee from this total to give you an idea of how far ahead in your annual budget this credit card can put you in terms of rewards. </span></p>\n<p><span>Keep in mind that this figure isn&rsquo;t included for credit cards that don&rsquo;t offer the option of redeeming reward points for gift vouchers, such as frequent flyer credit cards. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Rewards available</span></h3>\n<p><span>What exactly are the benefits of a rewards credit card? While the reward points you earn can be redeemed in a variety of different ways, depending on the credit card and the reward provider, some of the most common credit card rewards include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Flight rewards</span></strong><span> &ndash; some credit cards are specifically structured for frequent flyers, earning you points when you book flights and accommodation with your credit card, and earning you travel rewards such as concierge services and travel insurance.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Retail rewards</span></strong><span> &ndash; earn points by shopping at particular stores, or buying particular products, and redeem the reward points for discounts or freebies at selected retailers. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Cash back rewards</span></strong><span> &ndash; trade in your reward points for refunds on some of the money you&rsquo;ve spent so far.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Supermarket rewards</span></strong><span> &ndash; useful for anyone who does most of their credit card spending at the checkout, you may be able to earn discounts and free extras at your preferred supermarket.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>To claim or redeem one or more of these rewards, you may be able to spend your points directly in-store at partner retailers, or you may first need to log onto the website of your card&rsquo;s rewards program to select and claim your rewards. Some rewards may be claimed entirely using points, while other programs may allow you to combine your available points with a cash payment to make a discounted purchase. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Annual fee</span></h3>\n<p><span>How much your lender will charge you on top of the credit card&rsquo;s interest costs. This plays an important role in determining how much value your credit card can offer you in terms of rewards &ndash; if the value of the rewards you earn is mostly eaten up by the cost of the lender&rsquo;s fee, then you may want to consider alternative credit card options. </span></p>\n<h3><span>How to get the most out of credit card rewards: </span></h3>\n<p><span>Rewards credit cards tend to prove the most valuable to borrowers who are big spenders, and regularly use their plastic to pay for expenses large and small. If you can comfortably afford to spend several thousand dollars per month using your credit card, then the value of the rewards you earn should outstrip the cost of the credit card&rsquo;s fees. </span></p>\n<p><span>You&rsquo;ll also want to be confident that you can afford to clear your credit card balance each month, as the extra benefits offered by rewards credit cards often also mean these cards have higher than average interest rates. If you don&rsquo;t always pay back your credit card balance each month, you may prefer a simpler credit card with fewer rewards and a lower interest rate, to keep your financial situation under control. </span></p>\n<h3><span>How to earn credit card rewards</span></h3>\n<p><span>To earn reward points with a credit card, you need to spend money. Some credit card providers and reward programs have terms and conditions regarding where and how your credit card can be used to earn these points. </span></p>\n<p><span>For example, some supermarket rewards cards exclusively award points for shopping at that supermarket, or at a selection of affiliated retailers. Similarly, frequent flyer cards are usually associated with a particular airline group or travel alliance, allowing you to earn points by booking flights and accommodation with these companies. </span></p>\n<p><span>With this in mind, you&rsquo;ll want to choose a rewards credit card that suits your regular spending habits, so you can earn the maximum number of reward points without changing the way you shop.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Will all of my credit card spending earn me points?</span></h3>\n<p><span>Even for credit card reward programs that aren&rsquo;t directly associated with particular brands, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for certain transactions to be ineligible for earning rewards. Common exclusions include using your credit card to: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>pay bills</span></li>\n<li><span>pay taxes</span></li>\n<li><span>pay lender fees</span></li>\n<li><span>make cash advances</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>As always, it&rsquo;s important to check the terms and conditions with your lender to determine exactly what is and isn&rsquo;t eligible to be claimed as rewards on your credit card. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Credit card reward levels</span></h3>\n<p><span>Just like how some credit cards come in standard, Gold and Platinum variations, credit card reward programs often include several levels or tiers. The more money you spend on your card and the more reward points you earn and redeem, the higher the level you can reach. </span></p>\n<p><span>By reaching higher levels in your credit card&rsquo;s reward program, you may unlock additional bonus options for how you can earn and redeem your card&rsquo;s reward points. This can include access to special bonus offers, more flexible ways to earn rewards, or loosening or removing any caps or limits on the number of points you can earn.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Credit card reward caps</span></h3>\n<p><span>Some lenders put limits on the number of reward points you can earn per month or per year by spending money with your credit card. Once you hit this points cap, you won&rsquo;t earn any additional rewards if you keep on spending money with your credit card that month or year, which can limit the number of bonuses you can earn</span></p>\n<p><span>Credit card reward caps may prove frustrating for some &ldquo;big-spender&rdquo; borrowers, hoping to get maximum value from their rewards credit card. However, hitting the point caps on your credit card is often a signal to your lender that you&rsquo;re ready to move up to the next available level in your credit card&rsquo;s rewards program, which could loosen or remove the points caps. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Should I save or spend my credit card reward points? Will my reward points expire?</span></h3>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s often possible to save up the reward points from your credit card so that further down the track, you can make a large purchase or get a major discount from a participating retailer with the help of your reward points. </span></p>\n<p><span>That said, it&rsquo;s important to check whether your credit card&rsquo;s reward points will expire before you get a chance to redeem them. Some lenders only allow you to keep your reward points for a limited period before they expire. </span></p>\n<p><span>To get the most value from a credit card with expiring reward points, it&rsquo;s important to regularly claim any reward points you earn before you lose access to them. These cards can prove frustrating for borrowers who can only afford to spend small amounts of money per month, as by the time they save up enough points to afford the larger rewards they want, the points they earned early on may have expired.</span></p>",,590,274,1440,1287,359927,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,36597.75000000001,13.0

The reward can take the form of a cash-back, frequent flyer points, a gift or merchandise. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>How are shopping voucher rewards redeemed?</strong></h3>\n<p>Each credit card provider has a program with a collection of commercial partners, which are offering the rewards.</p>\n<p>So in the case of shopping voucher rewards, the points you accrue can be redeemed for any range of items offered by the program partners. Common partners include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supermarket chains</li>\n<li>Fashion and lifestyle retailers</li>\n<li>Airlines</li>\n<li>Entertainment and event groups</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most rewards are redeemed online, but many will have particular terms and conditions attached to either when they can be used, or how they can be used.</p>\n<p>For example, there may be certain high demand periods of the year when some rewards can&rsquo;t be used with a program partner; there may be restrictions placed on how many times you can claim a reward; or there may be an overall limit on a reward amount.</p>\n<h3><strong>Which banks offer reward programs?</strong></h3>\n<p>Many banks, building societies and financial institutions offer reward programs as they can apply a higher annual fee and interest rate to the card.</p>\n<p>The offer of a reward incentivises greater use of the card, so more card providers are designing reward programs which will appeal to the specific shopping preferences of customers.<br /> One program may offer rewards with premium brands to suit the lifestyle needs of a particular person, while another may offer rewards that are broader and have more mainstream appeal. Some banks may even offer multiple cards with different reward programs attached to them to cater to a wider range of customers.</p>\n<h3><strong>What should I know before I sign up?</strong></h3>\n<p>As enticing as reward programs are, you need to do your research so that it makes good sense for you, your everyday lifestyle and your financial goals. And this starts with being realistic and disciplined about your spending behaviour.</p>\n<p>There are four simple steps you can take into account if you&rsquo;re considering whether a rewards program is right for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask yourself if you&rsquo;ll actually use the rewards on offer</li>\n<li>Read the fine print on the annual fees and interest rates on the card</li>\n<li>Read the terms and conditions attached to redeeming the rewards</li>\n<li>Finally, do a cost-benefit analysis on comparable cards and programs so that you have a true financial representation of what each can offer you</li>\n</ul>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

However, as with any credit card, there are always things to consider.</p>\n<h3>What are credit card rewards?</h3>\n<p>Credit card rewards are incentives or extra benefits that come with your card.

You&rsquo;ll earn points in the form of &lsquo;miles&rsquo;, and how much you earn depends on your booking class and the distance travelled (e.g. a first class passenger flying 10 hours will earn more miles than a business class passenger flying three hours).</p>\n<p>To claim your air miles, all you need to do is quote your flight number when reserving a flight and present your credit card at check-in.</p>\n<h3>What are the benefits of&nbsp;having a credit card with Singapore Airlines points?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to earn miles every time you fly on an eligible Singapore Airlines or partner airline flight &ndash; regardless of your booking status (economy, business or first class).</li>\n<li>On higher tiers of the rewards program, you can enjoy benefits across all of Singapore Airlines&rsquo; partners: Virgin Australia, Virgin America, JetBlue, Alaska Airlines, SilkAir, Vistara and many more.</li>\n<li>Priority reservation waitlist: if you&rsquo;re waitlisted for a busy flight, you&rsquo;ll get priority. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Priority airport standby: if you need to take a last-minute flight, you&rsquo;ll get priority.</li>\n<li>Some travel service fees can be waived or reduced.</li>\n<li>Increased check-in baggage allowance, at no extra cost.</li>\n<li>Priority boarding.</li>\n<li>Complimentary lounge access at a range of worldwide airports.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What can you redeem&nbsp;Singapore Airlines points for?</h3>\n<p><strong>Free flights:</strong> Fancy a free flight? You can redeem Singapore Airlines points for a free flight with Singapore Airlines, SilkAir and their eligible partner airlines.&nbsp;Note: as with most frequent flyer programs, you will still need to pay taxes, fuel surcharges and fees in addition to your &lsquo;free flight&rsquo;.</p>\n<p><strong>Upgraded fares:</strong> If you feel like flying in style, you can use your points to upgrade from economy to business class or business class to first class. This also applies to most airline partners.</p>\n<p><strong>Rewards:</strong> If you&rsquo;re eyeing off a reward (such as new luggage), you can use your points to purchase it. And if you&rsquo;re short of the points required, you can pay the difference (as long as you have at least 50 per cent of the points).</p>\n<p><strong>Rewards for nominated family members:</strong> Feel like treating a loved one? You can also nominate a family member to use your points for a reward.</p>\n<h3>Where does Singapore Airlines fly to?</h3>\n<p>Singapore Airlines flies to over 60 international destinations across 30 countries. The airline&rsquo;s primary hub is in Singapore, and countries they fly to include Australia, India, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Beijing and most key destinations in Europe.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3>What are the pros of credit card rewards?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The rewards.</strong> Rewards, naturally, are the main attraction of a rewards credit card. Whether you want to use points for shopping and merchandise, free flights, a stylish travel upgrade or simply to treat a loved one, there are various pros of having a rewards program attached to your credit card. In the case of credit cards with Singapore Airlines points, frequent travellers can really benefit.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefits.</strong> Everyone likes a bit of special treatment. Priority service, luggage upgrades and lounge access all help to elevate your credit card&rsquo;s experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Bonus points.</strong>Some rewards credit cards offer bonus points for new customers. It&rsquo;s a great way to boost your points pool from the moment you sign up, and bring your rewards closer.</li>\n<li><strong>Affiliated partners.</strong> Singapore Airlines has 31 partners &ndash; meaning you can use your rewards in more places.</li>\n<li><strong>Travel insurance.</strong>A lot of rewards credit cards offer complimentary insurances on travel. This can include cancellation cover, accommodation cover for delays, car hire accident cover, lost luggage protection and more. The insurance can also cover your family members when they travel with you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the cons of credit card rewards?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pressure to spend more.&nbsp;</strong>The lure of earning points for exciting rewards can be a big temptation to spend on things you otherwise may not have. This can cause you to rack up a higher credit card debt and incur interest &ndash; detracting from any rewards you&rsquo;ll receive.</li>\n<li><strong>Monetary value</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The more money you spend on your card, the more points you&rsquo;ll earn. However, hundreds of thousands of points doesn&rsquo;t equal hundreds of thousands of dollars. In actuality, the cash value of earned points is just a fraction of what you paid to get it. If you look closely at the pay-off, you can easily spend thousands of dollars to receive one reward that might only cost tens of dollars.</li>\n<li><strong>High interest rates</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Rewards credit cards tend to have higher interest rates. This is their way of compensating for the extra benefits and rewards you can receive. So, unless you are really strict with paying off your balance in full each payment cycle, you can end up paying surplus interest.</li>\n<li>On top of higher interest rates, rewards credit cards can often have higher annual fees. This can offset the value you receive from your rewards.</li>\n<li><strong>Restrictions</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Your ability to earn points and redeem them for rewards is regulated by some restrictions and exceptions. Even benefits, like complimentary insurance, can have some detailed fine print attached to them. So always read the terms and conditions to make sure the rewards are as good as they seem &ndash; and complement your spending habits.</li>\n<li><strong>Point capping and expiry</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Planning on accumulating your points and redeeming them for something grand? Unfortunately, most credit cards only allow you to earn a certain amount of points per year, and they usually expire in around one to three years.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How do credit cards with Singapore Airlines rewards compare to other credit cards?</h3>\n<p>There is a plethora of rewards credit cards on the market, so be sure to do your research or ask a professional for advice. Qantas, Virgin and many other airlines offer rewards programs that are worth comparing before making a decision.</p>",,40,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,4.0,433.5

However, this is true only if the cost of making the purchases on your credit card to accumulate the points doesn&rsquo;t incur any additional costs, such as interest charged if you don&rsquo;t pay off the card amount in full.</li>\n<li><strong>Do the rewards fit your lifestyle? </strong>Credit cards that offer rewards that are not likely to be utilised or don&rsquo;t fit easily into your lifestyle largely defeats the purpose of having the program attached to the card. These cards often come with higher interest rates and fees, so this needs to be factored into if the reward is actually worth it. Look at all the card&rsquo;s features, particularly the interest rate and annual fee, beyond any introductory period.</li>\n<li><strong>Compare apples with apples. </strong>Many different banks and financial institutions will offer credit card programs that have been designed to appeal to various demographics and card users.

If you do suffer from a medical condition some cards may charge a premium for cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>* <strong>Cancellation fee protection for withdrawing from a planned holiday due to unseen circumstances. </strong>This can sometimes only cover the death of a relative, sudden illness of an immediate family member or natural disaster at your port of call or known residence.</p>\n<p>* <strong>Travel inconvenience cover.</strong> This is handy if your luggage goes west and you end up with cancelled or delayed flights.</p>\n<p>*<strong> Legal liability cover.</strong>&nbsp;If you damage someone else&rsquo;s property or injure someone you will be covered by this.</p>\n<p>But before setting off for your big adventure, be mindful of carefully reading what your policy covers and what it doesn&rsquo;t. For those who live on the edge, bad news is mishaps in extreme sports are generally not covered. So it pays to check before you play.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The positives</h3>\n<p>It is a good way to protect yourself, but the onus is on you to check what you are covered for. Traditionally, travel insurance linked to credit cards generally doesn&rsquo;t seem to have as much comprehensive cover as a separate individual travel insurance policy.</p>\n<p>Credit card insurance usually cover travellers as they age, while in contrast the standalone policies charge much higher premiums for older tourists, especially those over 65.</p>\n<p>It is also important to check if your spouse and children are covered, as come credit cards only protect the owners. Some credit cards do cover all family members, but this function may have to be activated for validity.</p>\n<h3>The negatives</h3>\n<p>On the negative side, complimentary travel insurance is valued as a premium attribute so it is normally offered on rewards credit cards that attract higher annual fees and interest rates. For the-not-so-frequent traveller, this may not be beneficial in the long term. Some premium cards can attract expensive annual levies. The higher excess fees can also trip up a lot of people. Credit card travel insurance policies usually cover trips up to a certain timeframe (like 31 days or three months) so it always pays to check the product disclosure statement (PDS) before assuming your trip will be covered.</p>\n<p>Typically, your travel insurance is activated when you use your credit card to book flights and accommodation. Cards may also expect you to buy a return ticket to validate insurance cover. Some cards offer the bonus of no overseas transaction fees on purchases whereas others can incur a charge of 2-4 per cent on every transaction made in foreign currency.</p>\n<p>Be mindful that most credit cards cover overseas trips only and not all travel policies will cover isolated terrorist-related incidents.</p>\n<h3>Last word</h3>\n<p>Credit card insurance can save time and money for the frequent traveller, but the level of cover differs depending on the type of card and the insurance writer.</p>\n<p>It is critical to compare your options; read the fine print so you can find a credit card or a standalone insurance that fulfil your travel needs.</p>",,880,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,88.0,227.5

Low-rate credit cards with interest rates under 10 per cent can help you keep your credit card debt under control and reduce the amount of overall interest you pay. Switching to a low-rate credit card can help you better manage your money while keeping your debt in check. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about credit cards with an interest rate under 10 per cent.</p>\n<h3>What is a low-interest-rate card?</h3>\n<p>Credit card interest rates can be confusing, especially with so many different cards and rates on the market. A low-interest-rate card is a credit card which charges you less than 10 per cent interest on your purchases. When you use your credit card, you&rsquo;re essentially using the bank's money instead of your own. Because the bank is footing the bill up front, they charge you interest to cover their cost of lending you the credit. Interest rates vary between cards depending on the bank and features, but generally speaking, the Australian average is between 14 and 19 per cent. A low-interest credit card basically means your card costs you less because you&rsquo;re paying less each month on interest payments.</p>\n<p>Low-rate credit cards tend to have fewer bells and whistles than other cards. While you may not earn rewards or frequent flyer points, many low-interest-rate cards offer interest-free periods of up to 55 days.</p>\n<h3>The benefits of a low-interest-rate card</h3>\n<p>The main benefit of a low-rate card is that you&rsquo;re charged a lower interest rate, meaning your credit card costs you less in the long run. A credit card with a low interest rate can help you keep your debt under control because you&rsquo;re paying less interest on the money you owe. The ultimate end game is to pay your credit card&rsquo;s balance in full at the end of the month, which means you get access to interest-free funds for a period of time. Sometimes, this doesn&rsquo;t happen because life gets in the way. That&rsquo;s where a low-interest-rate card can be of benefit. If you&rsquo;re struggling to pay your full monthly balance on the due date, or if you&rsquo;ve bought a big ticket item, then a credit card with a rate under 10 per cent can minimise the amount of debt you accumulate.</p>\n<h3>How do credit cards work?</h3>\n<p>Credit cards are similar to an unsecured personal line of credit. When you apply for a credit card, the bank will give you a credit limit which sets out how much money you can spend on your card. When you use a credit card, you&rsquo;re paying for the items upfront using the bank&rsquo;s funds. At the end of each billing period, which is usually monthly, the bank will send you a statement detailing how much you spent and what you need to pay back.</p>\n<p>Depending on the type of low-rate card you have, you might have the added benefit of interest-free days on your card. An interest-free period is a set amount of time where you can repay your card balance without being charged additional interest. Most cards usually come with 55 days interest-free. If you don&rsquo;t pay the full balance by the end of the interest-free period, the bank will start charging you interest.</p>\n<h3>How do I find out my interest rate?</h3>\n<p>While every card is different, most low-rate cards offer lower interest rates for purchases and leave the cash advance rate much higher. Each card has a different interest rate and fee structure depending on the type of card and the benefits on offer. Generally speaking, cards that offer rewards or frequent flyer points tend to have higher interest rates and fees than standard cards with no perks. To find out what your interest rate is, you can check your credit card statement, login to your internet banking or call the bank to check. If you signed up for a card with a low introductory rate or a 0 per cent promotion, there&rsquo;s a chance the honeymoon period is over and your rate has gone up. To avoid paying unnecessary interest, keep an eye on your interest rate.</p>\n<h3>How do banks charge interest on my credit card?</h3>\n<p>Every credit card has different rates, charges and features. Generally speaking, if you&rsquo;ve spent money on your credit card and haven&rsquo;t fully paid the closing balance each month, you&rsquo;re being charged interest. Because a credit card is essentially a loan from the bank, to make their money back they&rsquo;ll charge you interest on your purchases. If you&rsquo;ve got an outstanding credit card debt, the interest is usually calculated daily based on the balance and charged once per month.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve opted for a low-rate card with an interest-free period, you&rsquo;ve essentially got a window of opportunity to pay your card balance without paying any interest. If you don&rsquo;t manage to wipe the slate the clean in the interest-free period, interest will start accruing on the balance from that point onwards.</p>\n<h3>How do I avoid paying interest on my credit card?</h3>\n<p>The simplest way to avoid interest is to pay your credit card balance in full every month, but sometimes that can be a struggle. If you&rsquo;ve got a card balance that&rsquo;s climbing, consider switching to a card that has an interest rate under 10 per cent and offers you a 55-day interest-free period. The other option is to do a balance transfer to a credit card with an extended interest-free period.</p>\n<p>The most important thing to remember is that interest never disappears; it grows until you pay it off. To avoid a growing balance, set up a direct debit and try to pay more than the minimum amount due every month &ndash; ideally, the entire balance.</p>\n<h3>How to lower your credit card interest rate</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been a loyal card holder and you&rsquo;ve made regular repayments, you could call your card provider and try to negotiate a lower rate. If it&rsquo;s not possible to lock in a better deal, you could consider a balance transfer to a low-rate card. Before you make the switch, carefully consider what options you really need. Gold or platinum cards tend to attract higher interest rates and annual fees. <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/credit-cards"">Do your research</a></span> and work out whether it&rsquo;s worth the extra fees.</p>",,20,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2.0,473.5

But if you&rsquo;re an everyday credit card user who doesn&rsquo;t always pay off their full balance, finding a credit card with an interest rate under 12 per cent could save you money, time and worry.</p>\n<h3>What is credit card interest, and how can I avoid it?</h3>\n<p>Credit card interest is a fee that you pay in order to borrow money from your bank or credit provider. This is calculated on a percentage basis, otherwise known as your credit card interest rate. It&rsquo;s important to remember that all purchases made on credit cards are essentially &lsquo;borrowed money&rsquo;. If you don&rsquo;t pay the money back (i.e. pay off your credit card) within a certain timeframe, you will then accrue interest on top of your existing balance.</p>\n<p>This timeframe is also called your interest-free period, or number of interest-free days. Your number of interest free days will depend on which credit card you have, and is calculated based on your billing cycle, not on the date of purchase.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to avoid paying credit card interest is to pay your credit card bill in full, every month. In an ideal world such as this, no one would be paying any credit card interest. However, as human beings with imperfect spending habits, paying at least some credit card interest regularly is a reality for many of us. With this in mind, opting for a credit card with a low interest rate is one way to keep your finances in check.</p>\n<h3>How common is it to find credit cards with interest rates under 12%?</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not at all difficult to find a credit with with a low interest rate, especially from banks that are not part of the big four, which may offer a competitive interest rate to attract new customers and add a value proposition to their products.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll often find more than 25 credit cards available in Australia with an interest rate at or below 12 per cent. If you&rsquo;re in the habit of only paying off the minimum, or even just don&rsquo;t pay your bill in full each and every month, a low interest rate card could be a great option to save you money in both the short and long term.</p>\n<h3>What are the downsides to a low-interest credit card?</h3>\n<p>Not many low-interest rate cards offer the coveted $0 annual fee that many providers use as a selling point.</p>\n<p>Some even offer exactly zero interest-free days, making them a less attractive option for those of us who may not pay their bills like clockwork. Speaking of paying bills, expect to be slogged with a late payment fee if you do happen to exceed your interest-free days, whether that&rsquo;s 0 or 62.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t expect perks such as travel insurance, frequent flyer points or other rewards when opting for a low-interest credit card. These rewards come at a price, and usually that price is an interest rate around 20 per cent. You may find the occasional low-interest credit card that offers VIP seating for special events, or discounted travel insurance, but expect these perks to be subject to terms and conditions, and in no way guaranteed.</p>\n<p>A credit card with an interest rate of less than 12 per cent, or even in the single digits, is its main selling point. If you regularly use credit card rewards or perks and don&rsquo;t mind paying more interest for the privilege of doing so, this type of credit card may not be right for you.</p>\n<h3>Can I get a balance transfer on a low interest credit card?</h3>\n<p>If you have existing debt that you are trying to pay off, consolidating your debt into a balance transfer could be an option to simplify your repayment plan, especially if you have debt from multiple sources. Whether this is the right option for you will mostly depend on your personal circumstances, so it&rsquo;s important to do your own research and crunch the numbers.</p>\n<p>Balance transfer offers are less common for low-interest credit cards, but certainly not unheard of. Some may even offer a 0 per cent interest rate on balance transfers for the first 12 months, after which they revert to the credit card&rsquo;s standard (or higher) interest rate. If you have debt that can realistically be paid off in less than 12 months, you might consider a balance transfer in order to stop accruing interest on your existing debt.</p>\n<h3>Is a low-interest credit card right for me?</h3>\n<p>A low-interest credit card might be right for you if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don&rsquo;t pay off your credit in full each month, and want to pay less interest</li>\n<li>You&rsquo;re not in the habit of using credit card perks and rewards</li>\n<li>You have existing debt you wish to consolidate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with all financial decisions, whether or not a low-interest credit card is the right option for you will depend entirely on your circumstances, lifestyle and any existing debt.</p>",,20,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2.0,473.5

Interest rates are calculated as a percentage and shown as an annual figure, such as 21.7 per cent p.a. (per annum).</p>\n<p>Credit cards offer varying interest rates and charge for different types of transactions &ndash; the most common being a purchase rate and cash advance rate.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>How common are credit cards with interest rates under 14 per cent?</h3>\n<p>Interest rates can vary extensively from card to card &ndash; with some being in single figures and others above 20 per cent. Interest rates under 14 per cent are reasonably common.</p>\n<p>Interest rates are generally calculated based on the type of credit card and its inclusions.</p>\n<p>As a guide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gold, platinum and rewards credit cards will tend to have higher interest rates due to complimentary insurances or attractive rewards programs.</li>\n<li>Standard or &lsquo;no frills&rsquo; credit cards will tend to have lower interest rates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So while it&rsquo;s definitely possible to find credit cards with interest rates under 14 per cent, you&rsquo;ll likely be getting a basic credit card without a rewards program &ndash; and potentially a lower credit limit.</p>\n<h3>How is credit card interest calculated?</h3>\n<p>Despite interest being displayed as an annual percentage, most credit card providers calculate interest based on your daily balance, and add the charges to your account at the end of each statement period.</p>\n<p>To calculate how much interest you&rsquo;ll pay, you need to divide your card&rsquo;s annual interest rate by the number of days in a year (e.g. 21.7 per cent divided by 365). You can then apply this figure to the daily balance on your credit card.</p>\n<h3>What is an interest-free period?</h3>\n<p>Many credit cards offer interest-free periods in which no interest is charged on new purchases. The interest-free period for&nbsp;purchases starts at the beginning of the statement period (not the date on which you make the purchase) and ends on the date on which payment is due for that statement period.</p>\n<p>Note, the interest-free period only applies if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay the amount off within the interest-free period (which is often between 44 and 62 days)</li>\n<li>Pay off your previous month&rsquo;s balance in full by its due date</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How can I avoid paying credit card interest?</h3>\n<p>The simplest way to avoid interest is to pay off your balance in full every month (or within the interest-free period).</p>\n<p>So, it pays to always be proactive to stay on top of your payments. Also, avoid accumulating a balance that you can&rsquo;t comfortably pay back every statement cycle.</p>\n<p>Another way to avoid interest is with a balance transfer. Most banks run competitive balance transfer offers at least once a year. They allow you to transfer your credit card debt to another provider with a promotional low-interest offer &ndash; for example 0 per cent for 20 months. Balance transfers can be a good option if you have a large credit card balance that&rsquo;s incurring a lot of interest.</p>\n<h3>What is the minimum monthly repayment?</h3>\n<p>The minimum monthly repayment is the lowest amount you need to pay back on your credit card balance each payment cycle. While you are only required to pay the minimum amount, it&rsquo;s a good idea to pay more as your balance will be paid down quicker and incur less interest.</p>\n<h3>What types of credit card interest rates are there?</h3>\n<p>Interest can be a tricky thing to get your head around &ndash; especially because there are different types of interest rates. The most common ones are:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purchase interest rate &ndash; </strong>This is the interest rate that applies to credit card purchases in retail stores, departments and online.</li>\n<li><strong>Cash advance interest rate &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>This applies to cash that you withdraw from your credit card either via ATMs or cash equivalent transactions like gift cards.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance transfer interest rate &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>If you choose to do a balance transfer, your new credit card provider might charge you a one-off interest fee for transferring the debt (kind of like an administration fee).</li>\n<li><strong>Promotional interest rate &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Credit card companies offer promotional interest rates (such as balance transfer offers). It&rsquo;s important to note that while promotional interest rates are usually great offers (as little as 0 per cent), they revert to a higher interest rate after the promotional period ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How do I choose the best credit card for me?</h3>\n<p>With so many credit cards out there, it pays to take time to do your research. Ask yourself what you need: a low rate, travel rewards, shopping rewards, a promotional interest rate, a long interest-free period and so on. Even a small difference in interest rates can have an impact on your ability to comfortably manage your credit card.</p>",,20,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2.0,473.5

For many consumers, receiving the &lsquo;VIP&rsquo; or &lsquo;exclusive&rsquo; treatment can go a long way. This is why so many credit card providers offer pre-sale tickets and VIP seating at events for cardholders. Here&rsquo;s how to choose a credit card with VIP seating.</p>\n<h3>How does VIP seating work?</h3>\n<p>Credit cards with VIP seating will often allow cardholders to purchase exclusive, VIP seating or packages for special events. These event packages might include preferred seating, a food and drink package, or even meet-and-greets with the performers.</p>\n<p>VIP seating often also comes packaged with ticket presales for special events, before they go on sale to the general public. Credit card providers know that the overall entertainment package is important to consumers, so they will usually offer both, rather than one or the other.</p>\n<h3>How do I get VIP seating with my credit card?</h3>\n<p>If you have a credit card that includes VIP seating as a perk or benefit, keep an eye on your inbox. Most credit card providers will alert cardholders via email of an upcoming presale or VIP seating offer. These offers are usually only available for a day or two before ticket sales to the general public, so you will need to move fast in order to take advantage of the offer.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind that credit card providers offer these deals as a way of making money, not out of generosity. For this reason, you will most likely only notice presales or VIP seating for large events that will attract many customers, and many transactions.</p>\n<h3>How do I find a credit card with VIP seating?</h3>\n<p>Credit cards that offer VIP seating are usually advertised as a &lsquo;rewards&rsquo; or &lsquo;platinum&rsquo; credit card, so look out for these phrases when comparing credit cards.</p>\n<p>Some credit cards even have a name for their exclusive offers, such as Visa Signature Offers and American Express Invites. This will make it easier for you to find out what kind of events you can expect with a particular credit card.</p>\n<h3>Are there any downsides to credit cards with VIP seating?</h3>\n<p>Like all reward credit cards, these perks and benefits do not come free. As a general rule, the more generous the perks, the higher the annual fee. Some are even hundreds of dollars per year.</p>\n<p>Also, keep the interest rate in mind, as many of these credit cards will have high interest rates of around 20 per cent. Make sure that this is something that you can afford if you don&rsquo;t pay off your card in full each month.</p>\n<h3>Is a credit card with VIP seating right for me?</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in the habit of attending events regularly, want the VIP treatment and are willing to pay a higher annual fee and interest rate for the privilege, a credit card with VIP seating could very well be a great choice for you. But if the price is too high or not worth it to you, it&rsquo;s best to look for a more affordable credit card.</p>",,10,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.0,522.0

At the same time, if rates fall during the fixed period of your loan term you will not benefit from this.</p><p>Fixing your loan can be a gamble as it‰Ûªs extremely hard to predict rate rises or cuts, but if the rates do rise and you‰Ûªve already fixed your loan, you could save hundreds of dollars depending on the size and length of the mortgage.</p><p>If you are thinking you‰Ûªd like to fix your home loan while interest rates are low you don‰Ûªt have to fix it for the entire term length, consider a one year fixed mortgage.</p><p>Another attractive feature of a fixed rate mortgage is the ability to stabilise your repayments. While your interest rates are locked in place ‰ÛÒ so are your repayments. This allows many borrowers to budget their finances better as they know exactly how much money will be coming out of their account each month.</p><p>As with all mortgage options, there are downsides to consider. When choosing a fixed rate mortgage be aware that interest rates could be cut, in which case you could miss out on saving extra money off your repayments because you will be locked into the higher rate.</p><p>If you elect for a one year fixed period your mortgage will return to a variable interest rate after the year has expired.

You can fix just part of it, then have the option to switch to a variable rate or refinance.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why choose a ten year fixed rate loan?</strong></h3>\n<p>If the base interest rate is very low and you&rsquo;re able to source loans at very low rates, it may be worth fixing one for a long period, because then if the national rate rises again your monthly payments will remain low. Because it makes those payments predictable, this type of loan also has the advantage of making it easy for you to manage your money, so you don&rsquo;t have to be as cautious about spending. It protects you from potential problems caused by sudden rate rises.</p>\n<h3><strong>Who offers ten year fixed rate home loans?</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/10-year-fixed-rate"">Ten year fixed rate loans</a> are not available from every lender but the larger banks offer them. It&rsquo;s well worth taking your time to look around and source as many as you can before you start the process of deciding which is best for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>Comparing loans</strong></h3>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re considering home loans with a term as long as ten years, your main concern will be with the interest rate they offer, however, it&rsquo;s important to note that high fees sometimes accompany low interest rates. The last thing you want is to commit yourself to a loan that actually turns out to be more expensive because of this. Using the comparison rate to work out which loans are best will help to protect you from excessive charges, because it takes into account fees as well as rates.</p>\n<h3><strong>When to fix your rates</strong></h3>\n<p>Securing favourable interest rates is all about timing. Sometimes global economic events or political issues mean that you can predict when the market is likely to experience a slump. Being ready to make your move at that point means you are likely to secure lower rates than in ordinary circumstances. Never fix your home loan interest rates when the national interest rate is high.</p>\n<h3><strong>Extra features</strong></h3>\n<p>Loans with fixed interest rates don&rsquo;t usually offer many extra features. If you are going to make a ten-year commitment, however, features such as the option to make early repayments free of charge or at a low cost can potentially be very useful, so think through what you need carefully before you make your choice.</p>\n<h3><strong>Pros and cons</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixing at a low rate keeps your monthly payments low;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to predict your ongoing costs;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the interest rate falls, you could end up paying over the odds for a long time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",,10,10,183,227,3538,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,421.3,154.0

The extra time you save by already having your budget decided can be used to find the best furniture deals and decorate your new home.</p><p><strong>What happens at the end of a five year fixed mortgage rate?</strong></p><p>Once this fixed period comes to an end, typically your mortgage rate will revert to your lender‰Ûªs standard variable interest rate. That being said, your bank should offer you the opportunity to apply for another fixed term if that‰Ûªs what you are after, or the option to move to a more basic variable home loan option.</p><p>Regardless of which option you take, it‰Ûªs important to budget for a hike in your interest rate after your fixed term expires, just in case interest rates have gone up in this time period. You can use a home loan calculator to estimate your monthly repayments at various different interest rates. This will allow you to budget for rate increases and see if you would be able to comfortably pay off your mortgage in different scenarios.</p><p><strong>What about a split loan?</strong></p><p>A split loan lets you fix a portion of your loan, and leave the remainder on a variable rate so you get a bet each way on fixed and variable rates. A split loan is a good option for someone who wants the peace of mind that regular repayments can provide but still retain some of the additional features variable loans typically provide such an offset account. Of course, with most things in life, split loans are still a trade-off. If the variable rate goes down, for example, the lower interest rates will only apply to the section that you didn‰Ûªt fix.</p><p><strong>Start comparing</strong></p><p>If you think that a five year fixed mortgage is the right option for you then the next step is to start comparing and researching different loans. By using a comparison site you can look at not only the advertised interest rate but also the comparison rate that includes any other expenses associated with the loan including fees.</p><p>Compare some of the best five year fixed mortgage rates on the market below.</p>",,10,71,825,780,21368,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2414.05,57.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p>Before plunging into the numbers and how much of a deposit you need to buy a piece of real estate, let&rsquo;s start with the LVR part.</p>\n<p>LVR translates to &lsquo;loan-to-value ratio&rsquo;, which means how much money you can borrow versus the value of the property being purchased.</p>\n<p>This is a very important equation and will determine how much money you can borrow to buy a property, and whether or not you can purchase the property you want.</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re researching home loan products, most mortgages will list the LVR. This does vary from lender to lender, and loan to loan. The percentage of LVR will determine how much you need for a deposit.</p>\n<p>In the case of a 90 per cent LVR home loan, the mortgage amount (what you borrow) is calculated as 90 per cent of the property&rsquo;s value.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re allowed to borrow up to 90 per cent of the sale price, you would need a deposit of at least 10 per cent of the property&rsquo;s value to secure this type of loan.</p>\n<h3>Calculating the LVR of a home loan</h3>\n<p>An easy way of calculating LVR is to divide the purchase price of the property by 100 and then multiply that amount by the LVR.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say the property costs $1,000,000. If you divide by 100, the LVR would be $10,000; if you then multiplied by 90, you&rsquo;d get $900,000.</p>\n<p>Based on this calculation, you could deduce that you would need the difference between these two amounts ($100,000) as a deposit to qualify for the home loan. Of course, this figure doesn&rsquo;t factor in associated purchase costs such as stamp duty and conveyancing.</p>\n<p>This is only a guide, and not a hard and fast rule. Some lenders calculate the LVR based on a property&rsquo;s valuation, not the purchase price.</p>\n<p>The purchase (or listed) price of a property may differ from the property&rsquo;s actual value. Where there&rsquo;s a difference between these two figures, a lender or mortgage insurer may use the lower value.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that not all lenders require a valuation of the property.</p>\n<h3>What type of property can I purchase with a 90% LVR home loan?</h3>\n<p>Most 90 per cent LVR home loans are available for owner-occupiers, investment purchases, debt consolidation and refinancing. When doing your research, the loan should outline what it can be used for.</p>\n<p>Now that you know how to calculate a 90 per cent LVR home loan, and what you can buy, it&rsquo;s worth knowing whether you qualify.</p>\n<h3>Am I eligible for a 90% LVR home loan?</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve found a property to buy, and have a 10 per cent deposit plus additional funds for purchase costs such as legal fees, stamp duty and pest and building inspections &ndash; but what&rsquo;s your credit rating like?</p>\n<p>Your lender may not grant you a home loan just because you have the deposit; a bad credit rating could impact whether or not your application is successful.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the health of your credit rating, there are companies that can provide a copy of your credit history either for free (which takes longer), or for a relatively small fee (which is quicker).</p>\n<p>Another important factor to consider when applying for a mortgage is whether or not you have &lsquo;genuine savings&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Genuine savings is (generally) determined by the amount of cash you have in your bank account, and how long you&rsquo;ve been saving.</p>\n<p>For example, you might have saved the 10 per cent deposit over a period of years, which would be considered genuine savings. Or it might have been deposited recently by a family member, which might not be considered genuine savings.</p>\n<p>It will come down to the lender&rsquo;s discretion as to what it considers to be genuine savings.</p>\n<h3>Will I have to pay lender&rsquo;s mortgage insurance?</h3>\n<p>One final factor that will impact the amount you need to borrow to purchase a property will be lender&rsquo;s mortgage insurance (LMI).</p>\n<p>LMI indemnifies the lender against any financial losses in the event you default on your home loan repayments.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a one-off payment that is either paid by you as part of your deposit (thus increasing the amount you need for a deposit) or is added to the amount you borrow.</p>\n<p>LMI is generally applied to home loans with LVRs of more than 80 per cent, though this is not always the case. The cost of LMI depends on the value of the property being purchased.</p>\n<h3>What are the benefits of a 90% LVR home loan?</h3>\n<p>The obvious benefit of a 90 per cent LVR home loan is the amount you can potentially borrow. It&rsquo;s easier to save a 10 per cent deposit than a 20 per cent deposit.</p>\n<p>Another benefit is that it might allow you to qualify for a mortgage at all &ndash; something that might not be possible if you had to take out a home loan with an LVR of 80 per cent.</p>\n<p>And if you&rsquo;re already a home-owner, being able to secure a 90 per cent LVR home loan could mean you get to purchase another (investment) property and start to grow a real estate portfolio.</p>",,5,157,708,582,4961,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,768.6,115.0

A highly liveable city, Adelaide always has a healthy property demand due to the fact that most of the South Australian population live there.</p>\n<h2><strong>What do I need to know about Adelaide?</strong></h2>\n<p>Unlike many of Australia&rsquo;s major cities, Adelaide is highly planned in a grid configuration. This planning has provided ample parking, multi-lane roads and several parklands. The city sits on the southern coastline and features a number of popular beaches and tourist attractions. As one of Australia&rsquo;s most historic cities, Adelaide has been known for decades as the &lsquo;City of Churches&rsquo;. This makes the city highly attractive to tourists, with foreign and interstate travellers alike journeying to Adelaide for holidays.</p>\n<h2><strong>What about Adelaide&rsquo;s economy and property market?</strong></h2>\n<p>Adelaide is the hub of the local and state administrative and government bodies, as well as having financial institutions, defence industries, health services and manufacturing providing most of the employment and driving the city&rsquo;s economy.</p>\n<p>Historically, Adelaide has been one of the wealthiest of Australia&rsquo;s capital cities with a booming property market. This has been the case since around 2012 when a sharp decline in the market occurred. Adelaide is slowly recovering from this with prices now growing steadily. The reduction in the manufacturing industry in the state did contribute to this downturn and resulted in lower employment figures. Thankfully, lost employment opportunities and production has now been taken up by other industries.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>How does this compare to other capital cities?</strong></h2>\n<p>Although Adelaide does not have the level of industry of some other Australian cities, the presence of a defence industry and financial institutions does put the city on a par with Brisbane but just below Sydney and Melbourne. What the city lacks in industry it makes up for with a high liveability factor and less congestion. Adelaide&rsquo;s economy is also more stable than cities that rely on external factors and commodity prices to bolster its&nbsp;economy.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Why should I get a home loan in Adelaide?</strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">home loan</a> sector in Adelaide is regulated and managed nationally by the federal government. Most laws governing fees and loan rates stem from the Commonwealth government and national banking agencies. This makes the sector in the city similar to other capital cities in Australia. With less demand than other cities, Adelaide&rsquo;s property market is generally more affordable and offers more choice.</p>\n<p>The structured layout also makes the city a convenient and pleasurable place in which to live and work. The road network has roads with several lanes to ease traffic flow, and there are minimal roadworks and reduced traffic congestion with highways and expressways directing residents easily from the suburbs to downtown. The parklands and cultural features continue the visual appeal.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What problems might I encounter?</strong></h2>\n<p>Adelaide is subject to the same stamp duty and land taxes as other cities, as well as local government regulations and rates. Due to the historic nature of the city, heritage protection laws and regulations may cover some properties. This could mean you will be restricted as to how you can use or renovate the property. Also, Adelaide is subject to hotter and longer summers than most capital cities in Australia. This increases the risk of fire and drought; factors that need to be taken into account when you consider getting a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan</a> in the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,260,22,107,133,4974,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,570.4000000000001,130.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong>Home loans in Australia</strong></h1>\n<p>According to Commonwealth and state laws and regulations, there is an established process of obtaining a home loan in Australia. Basic parts of the home loan process including fees, property valuations, and property inspections are conducted in advance to ensure that the seller and purchaser are aware of all aspects of the property and the system before making a financial commitment. These regulations and laws vary depending on the state in Australia in which you purchase a property. All aspects of the home loan process should be researched thoroughly before taking out a loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What types of home loans are there in Australia?</strong></h2>\n<p>The two most popular home loan categories in Australia are&nbsp;variable interest rate home loans and fixed interest rate home loans. As the name suggests, a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/fixed-rate""><span>fixed rate home loan</span></a> has the same interest rate for all or a portion of the life of the loan. This rate is agreed upon before the home loan is signed off. Conversely, a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/variable-rate""><span>variable rate home loan</span></a> charges an interest rate that goes up or down depending on the official RBA cash rate, so it can be cheaper or more expensive than a fixed rate loan. Most home loan providers offer loans with both fixed and variable rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>How do these home loan rates in Australia compare to other countries?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are substantially more fixed rate than variable rate home loans in the US compared to Australia, and the US also places greater importance on credit scores than some Australian lenders. Countries like India and China, are culturally distinct from Australia in terms of higher rates of regulation on home loans and heavy restrictions on overseas borrowers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you get a home loan in Australia?</strong></h2>\n<p>The process of getting a home loan in Australia is similar whichever home loan provider you choose. The process does rely heavily on legal requirements and regulations compulsory for both borrower and the lender. The basic home loan approval process is fairly straightforward. After choosing your home loan and home loan provider, an initial application will be prepared. If your relevant details satisfy the lender, you will be provided with a conditional approval while the home loan provider conducts a credit check and property valuation. If everything comes out to be positive, you will receive approval for the loan. The funds can then be used to purchase your chosen property.</p>",,1900,0,5,2,58,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,196.85,187.0

Many loan providers shy away from the extra risk of lending to someone who has defaulted on loans in the past or committed other financial transgressions. Sometimes events outside your control, such as prolonged illness, job loss or divorce, can result in financial problems that make it difficult to access credit. Bad credit home loans are designed specifically to help and aim to assist you to finance purchases to refurbish property or to buy your own home.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why opt for bad credit home loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Australia has a number of specialist lenders who provide a service for borrowers with mortgage arrears and other financial problems, such as unpaid bills or frequent missed or late payments. They recognise that people with a chequered credit history experience difficulty when they seek to invest in property or buy their own home. The products offered by these lenders are sometimes known as specialist or non-conforming home loans. They tend to have flexible lending conditions and are also often offered to self-employed borrowers. <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/bad-credit"">Bad credit home loans</a></span> often have a higher rate of interest and greater annual fees than other loans.</p>\n<h3><strong>What do lenders assess when considering bad credit home loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Bankruptcies and other defaults are noted and your lender will ask for a detailed explanation for every item. Trying to hide something is not advisable as your application may be refused if the lender considers you are not being transparent and honest.</p>\n<p>The type of credit you have applied for will also be analysed &ndash; too many credit card applications signals a potential borrower who is dependent on credit. If you&rsquo;ve made lots of applications for home loans, on the other hand, this can be attributed to the fact that you are looking for the best deal available.</p>\n<p>If you frequently make a lot of applications for credit your chances of getting a home loan will be adversely affected unless you can provide a good reason for this.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the significant bad credit home loan features?</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite a poor credit history you should still look for favourable loan terms including affordable repayments. Check that the frequency of repayments suits you and whether you will have access to an offset account or a redraw facility. Expect to pay higher fees but still make a point of seeking out the most competitive loans.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>What are the rewards and risks?</strong></h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s inevitable that you will pay higher fees and interest rates for a bad credit home loan. This may include higher exit fees if you pay the loan off before the term ends.</p>\n<p>On the positive side you will benefit from increased flexibility in the criteria for lending, and if your bad credit home loan is at a fixed rate you will be protected from fluctuating interest rates. In the longer term, as long as you stick to the loan agreement and make your repayments in full and on time, your credit rating will definitely improve.</p>",<p>xx</p>,1600,0,0,4,403,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,200.9,183.0

Find a great mortgage and interest rate that suit your needs on RateCity,,,,,,"<h2>Best home loan rates</h2>\n<p>Getting the best interest rate for your home loan is an important consideration because the lower your interest rate, the less your repayments will be month to month. While this is important, it&rsquo;s also essential to consider the comparison rate on your home loan as it includes any hidden fees and charges that can often be included in a product. The comparison rate also makes it easy to compare different products side-by-side - apples for apples.</p>\n<h2>Interest rate</h2>\n<p>The interest rate on your home loan is the percentage of interest you pay on the amount you owe the bank. The lower the rate, the less your repayments will be.</p>\n<p>If you have a variable home loan, this interest rate will be decided by your lender and depend on a range of factors such as market conditions, the RBA cash rate and other considerations. Be aware that banks can lift or drop rates at any time so while you might be on a good rate initially, it&rsquo;s important to keep an eye on what rate you are on and what other lenders are offering over the life of your loan.</p>\n<p>If you choose a fixed-rate home loan instead, the interest rate will remain the same for the fixed term period you choose (typically between 1 and 5 years). Keep in mind that even though you might have chosen the best interest rate on the market at the time, your fixed home loan rate might not be so attractive if the cash rate drops and your bank follows suit. Conversely, if your bank&rsquo;s variable rate rises in this time it might put you ahead.</p>\n<p>Before you sign up to a fixed rate loan it&rsquo;s a good idea to understand what features it does and doesn&rsquo;t include, such as the ability to make extra repayments, as these products can sometimes be less flexible than their variable counterparts. Additionally, find out what the fees and charges are applicable over the life of your loan, including the revert rate after your fixed term expires, as this can often be higher than market rate.</p>\n<h2>Comparison rate</h2>\n<p>A comparison rate is different to an interest rate because it factors in the other expenses associated with your home loan including most of fees and charges you could incur, and the revert rate if there is an introductory period. For this reason it is a useful tool for deciding between loans that may have a similar advertised interest rate but in reality will cost you different amounts over the life of your loan.</p>\n<h2>Revert rate</h2>\n<p>The revert rate of a home loan is the interest rate you will pay on your loan following the introductory or fixed term period. While not all loans have a different interest rate for the introductory period it is advisable to pay close attention to the ones that do before signing up.</p>\n<p>These loans may have an advertised interest rate that appears to be the best home loan rate available but the revert rate may be a lot higher than other loans on the market and as a result, make the product less cost effective in the long run.</p>\n<h2>Choosing a home loan</h2>\n<p>If you are ready to start comparing and choosing a home loan the comparison table on RateCity is a good place to start. You will be able to look at the interest rate, comparison rate and fees of different mortgages side by side to find some of the best deals available.</p>\n<div style=""max-width: 720px; text-align: left;""><em>*The phrase&nbsp;&lsquo;some of the best&rsquo; is not a recommendation or rating of products.&nbsp;This page compares a range of home loans from selected providers, not all products or providers are included in the comparison.&nbsp;No home loan is one size fits all.

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong>Best home loan interest rates</strong></h1>\n<p>To find the one of the best available rates on your home loan, there are a number of factors you&rsquo;ll need to consider. The rate you can get will depend on your personal financial circumstances, so even if you can&rsquo;t find the perfect loan straight away, there may be changes you can make that will improve the deals you&rsquo;re offered.</p>\n<h3><strong>Comparing rates</strong></h3>\n<p>Interest rates on loans are often presented in different ways, and can be difficult to understand. When you&rsquo;re making your choice, you should look at the comparison rate, which also takes fees into account and is designed to give you a straightforward way of working out what is the best home loan interest rate.</p>\n<h3><strong>Your credit history</strong></h3>\n<p>One major factor that will influence the rates available to you is your credit history. The better your credit rating, the lower the rate you will be able to negotiate, while if you have bad credit you may sadly find that you are ineligible for many of the cheaper loans. You can improve your credit by always paying bills on time and making sure any money you borrow is paid back as agreed.</p>\n<h3><strong>LVR</strong></h3>\n<p>The other major factor that can help you access lower interest rates is the LVR &ndash; or Loan to Value Ratio &ndash; that you are seeking. If you have a big deposit to put on the property you want, the LVR will be lower than if you only have a small deposit. This will mean your lender is taking less of a risk, so may&nbsp;be able to offer a lower rate.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fixed rate loans</strong></h3>\n<p>Fixed interest rates are usually slightly higher to begin with but because they won&rsquo;t change, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about having to pay more if the RBA&nbsp;cash rate goes up. You&rsquo;ll always know what your payments will be, which can really help if you&rsquo;re on a budget.</p>\n<h3><strong>Variable rate loans</strong></h3>\n<p>Variable rate loans usually offer the cheapest rates to begin with and they can be even cheaper if the national interest rate falls. The flip side of this is that they can also become more expensive if it rises. They often come with special features than can help you save money overall.</p>\n<h3><strong>Split rate loans</strong></h3>\n<p>Split rate loans allow you to fix a portion of the loan, giving you stability, but also allow you to take advantage of some of the flexibility of a variable rate loan. They can help you to balance saving money with minimising risk.</p>\n<h3><strong>Introductory rates</strong></h3>\n<p>Many lenders try to attract borrowers by offering introductory rates so you will pay less for the first few months of your loan.

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h2>Best LVR home loans*</h2>\n<p>When you're examining options to finance your new home, you need to not only take the time to explore those options in depth but also to be absolutely clear as to what you are taking on in the form of a loan. Mortgages are a familiar concept for anyone who wants to buy or has already bought a property, but how do mortgage companies make the decisions as to whom they will lend and how much they will permit you to borrow? Some of the terminology can be tricky if finance is not your field (and for most people, it isn't), but you can learn enough to get a broader understanding of what everything means. One of these aspects is the term LVR, and when you know about that, it will make your decision-making when negotiating a loan easier.</p>\n<h2>What are the best LVR home loans?</h2>\n<p>Firstly, you need to be clear about what LVR means. In basic terms, a mortgage company will look at the value of the home you want to buy, how much you want to borrow to buy it, and what level of deposit you will be putting forward to try to secure it. LVR means Loan to Value Ratio and relates to the property's purchase value in proportion to how much money you require from the lender.</p>\n<p>As an example, let's say you want to buy a house valued at $400,000 and you have a deposit of $100,000 to put down. Therefore you want to ask the lender for &pound;300,000, so the relationship between $300,000 and $400,000 is 75% ($300,000/$400,000) &ndash; that's your LVR. LVR rates differ depending on the home valuation and how much money you can place as a deposit. A 75% LVR is below the 80% that is generally the minimum that most loan providers will lend on, though you may discover ones that will go for 85% or 90%. However, as the risk is greater for lenders with higher LVR loans, you'll pay more in terms of your interest rates and, quite likely, your set-up costs.</p>\n<h2>How do these types of loans compare with others?</h2>\n<p>It's important to remember that these are mortgages to enable you to buy a home. You should do plenty of research to get useful comparisons because companies differ in what they will offer when looking at LVR. The bigger deposit you have, the more likely you are to get an attractive interest rate from the start because your LVR percentage is lower. If you have an LVR below 80% you will usually have to have lenders' mortgage insurance, a one-off payment that protects your lender in case you default.</p>\n<h2>What risks are associated with these loans?</h2>\n<p>When you take out a loan make sure you are able to pay it back in the agreed instalments. If personal circumstances change and you are unable to make the repayments for a time you must talk to the lender. Lenders would much rather you paid back less on a regular basis than defaulting completely.</p>\n<script src=""//blaze.ratecity.com.au/blaze-assets/compareWidget.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>\n<div style=""max-width: 720px; text-align: left;""><em>*The phrase&nbsp;&lsquo;some of the best&rsquo; is not a recommendation or rating of products.&nbsp;This page compares a range of home loans from selected providers, not all products or providers are included in the comparison.&nbsp;No home loan is one size fits all.

Everyone is different, which is why your mortgage comparison is so important.</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>Estimate your borrowing power:</h6>\n<h3>How much can I borrow?</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://ratecity.com.au/home-loans/how-much-can-i-borrow"">Find Out</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>Here is an explanation of some of the key factors that will assist you in determining what to look for when attempting to find the most suitable mortgage:</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Interest rate</span></strong></h3>\n<p><strong><span><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161026143848/interest-rate-resized-compressor.jpg""> <img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-55667"" alt=""interest-rate-resized-compressor"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161026143848/interest-rate-resized-compressor.jpg"" /></a></span></strong></p>\n<p><span>One of the first considerations to take into&nbsp;account before you start looking for the best mortgage interest rates is to decide whether you're looking for a variable or fixed interest rate. Keep in mind that the best mortgage interest rates for your finances&nbsp;may not necessarily be the lowest rates.</span></p>\n<p><span>Most mortgages are based on a variable interest rate that will fluctuate over time, often in line with the Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate. There are, however, some mortgages available that will allow you to lock in a low fixed interest rate for a period of time, which will assist you in planning for future repayments. Once you've decided on which type of loan you would like, it's time to start comparing home loan interest rates to find the lowest&nbsp;mortgage rates.</span></p>\n<p><span>During this process you will most likely notice that many of the lowest rates on the market are available only to borrowers with a large deposit, as they are considered to be less risky by lenders. For this reason, there is no best home loan&nbsp;for all borrowers, as some borrowers will have access to lower mortgage interest rates depending on the size of their deposit and also whether they are an owner-occupier or investor. This is why using the customisable search function of our&nbsp;rate table will assist in revealing the ideal mortgages for your circumstances, offering the best mortgage rates for your unique household.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Fees</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Another consideration when&nbsp;looking for a good home loan will be the fees that are charged. There are many different types of fees to be aware of when looking for the cheapest&nbsp;home loan. These can include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>establishment fees;</span></li>\n<li><span>settlement fees;</span></li>\n<li><span>fees for using features such as an offset account of redraw facility, and;</span></li>\n<li><span>fees associated with making extra repayments.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, that doesn&rsquo;t even cover the whole gamut of fees out there, so researching potential loan options thoroughly and enquiring about the fees they charge&nbsp;should be a must when looking for the best mortgage for your needs.</span></p>\n<p><span>It's also possible to find cheap home loans that charge relatively little to no fees, so don&rsquo;t think that you need to be locked into paying thousands in unnecessary costs. You can also negotiate with a lender when you are refinancing or taking out a new loan to waive some of the upfront costs. If they want your business&nbsp;(and they usually do), they will be willing to give you a discount to keep you happy. For this reason, the most suitable mortgage for your needs may not necessarily be exactly what&rsquo;s advertised online, but perhaps a tailored loan arranged by contacting a lender.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Features</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>When trying to figure out what the best home loan&nbsp;looks like for your needs, you should also consider the impact that different features can have on your home loan. For example, choosing a loan with an offset account can assist you in reducing the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan. The account functions as a transaction account linked to your mortgage, and keeping your spare cash in there can&nbsp;minimise the principal amount you are charged interest on.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>Are they the same thing?</h6>\n<h3>Mortgage offset accounts and all in one home loans</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/mortgage-news/mortgage-offset-accounts-and-all-in-one-home-loans"">Learn More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>Another feature that can&nbsp;assist you in reducing the amount of interest charged on your loan will be the extra repayments feature, which allows you to go above and beyond your regular repayments to pay down your loan faster. By reducing the principal amount owed on your loan at the fastest rate possible, you can&nbsp;potentially cut&nbsp;thousands off your total interest bill.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some mortgages offer the option to make interest-only repayments for a certain period. This may not be the best option for all borrowers, as it may&nbsp;end up costing the borrower more in the long term, but it does have advantages for certain people. For example, if you're a first home buyer, you may like to take advantage of slightly lower monthly repayments at the beginning of your loan to ease you into the routine. Alternatively, borrowers who experience an unexpected lifestyle change, like a partner losing their job or increased medical bills, may want to drop their payments down to an interest-only level while they adjust their finances.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>Want to know more?</h6>\n<h3>Home loan repayment methods</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/articles/home-loan-repayment-methods"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>One&nbsp;common feature that will allow you to take advantage of the best parts of different mortgages is opting for a split loan. A split loan is a mortgage that has part of the interest charged at&nbsp;a fixed rate and another portion at&nbsp;a variable rate. This style of mortgage is intended for borrowers who can&rsquo;t decide between a fixed or variable loan and want to take advantage of the benefits that each has to offer.</span></p>\n<p><span>These are only some of the many features that are available with different types of mortgages and lenders. When deciding what the best mortgage looks like for you, you should take into account the type of features that you think are most likely to assist you in future. Whether these are features that will help you save money on interest in the long run, or allow you to be flexible with repayments, finding out more about features can help you narrow down what will be the ideal mortgage for you.</span></p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-tip"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">Making repayments</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>During your search for a new home loan, you should use a mortgage calculator to estimate how much your monthly repayments will be. This can assist you with budgeting to make sure you can afford the repayments comfortably and perhaps even make some extra repayments along the way. Some house loans will allow you to make weekly, fortnightly or monthly repayments, and this flexibility can be helpful in syncing your payments with your pay cycle. The more frequently you make repayments, the more you will be able to save on interest over the life of the loan, as most mortgages calculate interest on a daily basis.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2><span></span><span></span></h2>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>calculate your repayments</h6>\n<h3>Mortgage repayments calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">Calculate</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><strong><span>Bank vs non-bank</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>When searching for a suitable home loan, you may have noticed that some&nbsp;of the lowest current mortgage rates on the market are offered by non-bank lenders. For borrowers who have never banked with this type of lender before, you may be wondering what the advantages are of taking your mortgage out with one of these lenders. </span></p>\n<p><span>The most obvious advantage&nbsp;is a more competitive home loan rate that will most likely stay lower than the Big 4 banks' mortgage interest rates as the smaller lender fights to keep your business. These lenders are often customer-owned, which gives your priorities as a borrower a much bigger role to play in the lender&rsquo;s decision-making process. Customers of smaller lenders also report being happier with the service provided to them compared to customers of the Big 4 banks.</span></p>\n<div class=""rc-embed-widget"" data-rc-colour=""63738c"" data-rc-url=""//blaze.ratecity.com.au/widgets/compare/home-loans/big4/state-custodians/low-rate-home-loan-with-offset-lvr-less-than-80?h_maxBorrowingAmount=400000&h_maxLoanTerm=30""></div>\n<script src=""//blaze.ratecity.com.au/blaze-assets/embedWidget.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>\n<p><span>Still, many borrowers prefer the tried and tested security of the Big 4 banks, which can offer some convenient package deals for borrowers who want to keep all of their financial products in the one place. For an annual fee, customers of the Big 4 banks can tie in their transaction account, credit cards and mortgages, and manage them all on the one app. This sort of convenience appeals to many borrowers, and your preference should be factored into your mortgage decision.</span></p>\n<p><span>Depending on whether you are a first home buyer or refinancer, the ideal mortgage for you will vary. One of the major differences between these borrower types is that a refinancer often has a larger deposit available in the form of equity built into their current property. These types of borrowers can harness the power of that equity to get some of the cheapest&nbsp;home loan interest rates in Australia. These rock bottom mortgage interest rates are often available to borrowers who are borrowing less than 80 per cent of the property value, which rules out many first home buyers with small deposits.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are, however, certain cheap home loans that profess to cater to first home buyers specifically by offering honeymoon interest rates. These deals offer customers a lower introductory interest rate for a certain time period before it reverts to a higher home loan rate. This revert rate is often much higher than what other house loans on the market are offering, and over the lifetime of the loan, borrowers will end up paying more in interest than if they had opted for a loan without the honeymoon rate. Checking the comparison rate of a home loan, as well as the interest rate, will give you a better idea of its overall value, as the comparison rate&nbsp;takes the loan's&nbsp;fees and revert rates into consideration.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>What are the next steps in finding the best mortgage?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161209141950/mortgage-search.jpeg""> <img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" alt=""businessman is using internet search bar to  find real estate"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161209141950/mortgage-search.jpeg"" /></a></strong></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling confident to begin your search for a suitable mortgage, you can use our&nbsp;comparison table to customise your search, compare current mortgage rates, and look at some viable options.

The guide expands on the different features and fees included in a mortgage, and will also give you information relevant to the type of borrower you are.

There will be plenty of fine print to go through, and it's critical that you understand it as thoroughly as possible before signing up for the product.

There are four big banks in the country that play a key role in the economy and are regulated and managed well. The Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac and NAB are financially stable and any financial dealings you have with them will be safe. The big four have a very large market share of home loans, with close to an 85&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;share between them.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>What are </strong><strong>home loans with the Big Four banks</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>As important players in Australia's financial sector, the big four banks offer home loans as well as a wide range of other financial services. <span>Home loans with the big four banks</span> offer a degree of safety in terms of your home loan due to the regulation they undergo that is designed to absorb financial shocks. The stability the Australian government wanted to impose on the financial sector was in response to the global financial crisis, which began in the United States of America in 2008. This now means that financial institutions have to hold a certain amount of capital to absorb losses, should they occur. However, any guarantees only apply to deposits you make, such as savings, not home loans.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do </strong><strong>home loans with the big four banks </strong><strong>compare to other products?</strong></h3>\n<p>The size of the big four banks gives them a powerful grasp on the home loans business. There is enormous competition between them and smaller lenders, so in order to get your business they sometimes offer competitive interest rates, and if one does so it's quite likely the others will follow. Whether or not this is competitive with what other lenders are offering needs to be researched before you decide on a particular lender because you may discover better interest rates and loan features elsewhere. Often smaller lenders are able to be more competitive because they have lower overheads.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of </strong><strong>home loans with the big four banks</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>The big four banks offer a wide variety of <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan products</a></span> so you have a range of options to choose from. Whether you want a basic home loan or one with features such as redraw facilities or an offset account, these financial giants have most bases covered. You can be fairly certain that if there is another major financial crisis these banks will be able to weather the storm and your home loan should remain unaffected. Remember, though, nothing is ever 100&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;certain in the world of finance.</p>\n<h3><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong></h3>\n<p>Home loans with the big four banks can be considered reasonably safe. They can offer loans and rates that are better packaged, thanks to their scale of operation, and you may feel they are more to be trusted than other lenders. They have a large ATM network if you have a loan with a redraw facility or want to make an additional repayment to reduce your loan. Interest rates, however, may be higher, and customer service may not be as responsive as with some of the smaller lenders.</p>",,5,4,25,21,590,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,68.4,243.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong>Bridging home loans</strong></h1>\n<p>When you need to move into a new property but you haven&rsquo;t yet sold your old one, a bridging home loan can help. This form of finance is specially designed to make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on buying a new property because of temporary cash flow problems. It can be organised very quickly to help the process of moving go smoothly.</p>\n<h3><strong>How does a bridging home loan work?</strong></h3>\n<p>A loan like this means that you can access the funds you need to pay for a new home even before you have received money for your old home. There are two different types of bridging loan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open bridging loans;</li>\n<li>Closed bridging loans.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Open bridging loans are available to people who haven&rsquo;t yet found buyers for their existing properties. They&rsquo;re usually arranged for a 12-month period and there has to be a plan in place for what will happen if the property isn&rsquo;t sold by then. You&rsquo;ll have to demonstrate that you are making an effort to find a buyer and you will need to have a reasonable amount of equity in the property you&rsquo;re selling.</p>\n<p>Closed bridging loans are available to people who have found buyers for their existing properties but haven&rsquo;t yet completed all the paperwork. Because there&rsquo;s less chance of things going wrong at this stage, these loans are usually quite a bit cheaper.</p>\n<h3><strong>Bridging loans and building</strong></h3>\n<p>A bridging home loan can also be used if you&rsquo;re building the home you want to move into. It can free up funds to cover the cost of the build so that you are able to stay in your current property until the new one is ready. This is considerably cheaper than renting in the meantime and it will reduce your overall moving costs.</p>\n<h3><strong>How does a bridging loan compare to similar products?</strong></h3>\n<p>Most people find it very difficult to borrow this amount of money through a general loan. There&rsquo;s an alternative option for securing your new property, which is to place a deposit bond on it. The value of this bond will depend on the value of the property you&rsquo;re trying to buy, and it will mean you have more time to find the funds you need. You won&rsquo;t need to pay interest this way, but if you can&rsquo;t raise the funds by the agreed date then you will lose your deposit. A bridging loan costs money in interest but offers more flexibility with generally lower overall risk.</p>\n<h3><strong>Main features</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Easy to arrange;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gives you fast access to funds;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bridges the gap between buying and selling;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Helps if you want to build your new home.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Risks and rewards</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Closed bridging loans are low cost and low risk. Open bridging loans carry more risk but as long as you work out your contingency plans carefully with the help of a financial adviser, you should be able to avoid finding yourself in trouble. The more honest you are when arranging your loan, the less likely it is that things will go wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Having a bridging loan in place makes the process of moving from one owned property to another far less disruptive. Properly managed, it can also make it considerably less expensive overall.</p>",,90,39,393,352,16327,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1772.95,73.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong>Home loans in Brisbane</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>The most populous city in the large state of Queensland, Brisbane has become a popular choice for homeowners and investors due to the great lifestyle and high levels of employment in the city&rsquo;s CBD. The property market in the city is generally stable with steady price growth and high rental tenancy rates. It can be a good choice for people looking to live in a capital city without the cost and congestion of Sydney or Melbourne.</p>\n<h2><strong>What do I need to know about Brisbane?</strong></h2>\n<p>Residents of Brisbane live on either the north or south side of the city with the Brisbane River dividing the two areas. The CBD and popular Southbank precinct are situated on both sides of the river. The CBD has both heritage and modern buildings intermingled with historic churches and memorials. Due to its shopping and restaurants, man-made beach and cultural centres, Brisbane is a popular tourist destination, with thousands of international and interstate visitors converging on the city each year. It is also in close driving distance of Queensland&rsquo;s secondary tourist attraction, the Gold Coast, with its great beaches and theme parks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Brisbane&rsquo;s economy and property market like?</strong></h2>\n<p>In addition to a thriving tourism sector, Brisbane is the centre of the local and state administration and governance as well as having several information technology and financial businesses. The city is the headquarters of several multinational companies. The city also features the Port of Brisbane from which a variety of goods are exported to other Australian ports and overseas. Those industries have proven more stable than some, particularly the mining and resources sector, and have contributed to the city&rsquo;s stable economy and good employment figures. The property market, therefore, is steady with mostly positive growth and high tenancy rates. There are land shortages in some popular and inner city suburbs with a resulting increase in apartment building in these areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Why should I get a home loan in Brisbane?</strong></h2>\n<p>Brisbane&rsquo;s stable economy and employment levels make it attractive to families looking for a lifestyle change and investors looking for a reliable income source. Despite this, demand for housing in Brisbane is not as high as in similar cities, such as, Melbourne and Sydney. The city does have land towards the south of the city that is still being developed and is increasing supply. Housing affordability is therefore quite good, although properties are more expensive than in more isolated capital cities, such as, Perth, Hobart and Darwin. The <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan</a> sector is managed mostly by the federal government and has similar regulations to other cities in Australia.</p>\n<h2><strong>What potential problems could I encounter?</strong></h2>\n<p>Due to Brisbane&rsquo;s CBD being situated around a river system, there can be high demand for riverside, &lsquo;lifestyle&rsquo; properties in the city&rsquo;s inner suburbs. This can reduce the amount of available properties and you will need a high-range budget to purchase in these areas. Also due to many heritage properties being located in the city - mainly in the inner suburbs - there are many state and federal regulations that govern the purchase, development and renovation of the properties. Lastly, you will have to pay the usual stamp duty, land taxes and rates that are generally required from local and state governments. You should research these <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">costs</a> when budgeting your property buying process.</p>",,210,16,63,52,3853,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,431.55,152.0

Using a small number of details, such as your buyer status (home buyer or refinancer), your deposit amount, loan amount and whether you plan to live in the property or invest, it shows you what your repayments would be if you chose a loan with some of the low rate lenders on the market. To tailor the results further, it asks you which state you plan to buy and whether you are choosing an existing property or a new property. This is because lenders sometimes charge different rates for borrowers in new properties versus existing properties. There is also a state to state variance, as states and territories tend to charge different rates for <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/calculators/stamp-duty-calculator"">stamp duty</a>.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that while this tool does its best to calculate a result based on a number of factors, it is not personalised and should not be viewed as a substitute for tailored advice.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why you would use a home loan calculator?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of reasons potential borrowers may choose to use a home loan or mortgage calculator. Here are some of the main ones:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To find a low rate </strong>&ndash; a home loan repayment calculator helps borrowers to find lenders that are offering interest rates in their target range. By comparing rates, borrowers can find out how much they would pay over the life of a loan with a higher rate versus a lower rate.</li>\n<li><strong>To find out if you can afford to borrow</strong> &ndash; there are several reasons a borrower may attract a high rate or be ineligible for a loan. These include having a small deposit or a high borrowing amount. By entering your deposit and your intended borrowing amount, you can see what sort of rate you may attract and then match the repayment amount with your salary to determine if you can afford to take on a loan at this time.</li>\n<li><strong>To find out how much you&rsquo;ll pay in interest</strong> &ndash; on top of principal, lenders require borrowers to pay interest over the loan. A mortgage calculator can tell you how much you could pay in interest compared to how much you could pay in principal.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-tip"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">Example</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>Sarah has saved a deposit of $70,000 to buy an apartment in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta. She plans to live in the property. The apartment is in an older building, rather than off the plan. Before she decided to she wanted to buy, she had the property valued and learned it was worth $350,000. This places the building within her expected price range and meant her saved deposit equals 20 per cent. The mortgage payment calculator tells Sarah she will need to borrow $311,240 to secure her property. That&rsquo;s $280,000 for the cost of the property, $11,240 for <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/calculators/stamp-duty-calculator"">stamp duty</a> in NSW and $20,000 for other costs, such as fees and conveyancers. On the date she made the calculation, Sarah discovered four lenders were offering mortgages with interest rates of 3.73 per cent and monthly repayments between $1400 and $1500 a month.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2><strong>Other factors that could affect your calculation, rate and loan offers</strong></h2>\n<p>Not everyone gets offered the same interest rate from lenders and borrowers often wonder why. Here are some of the things that could affect your interest rate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The type of property</strong> &ndash; Is it a new or existing dwelling?</li>\n<li><strong>The type of buyer</strong> &ndash; Are you an investor? An owner-occupier? A first-time buyer?</li>\n<li><strong>The size of the deposit</strong> &ndash; Is your deposit below 20 per cent of the property value? If so, you may have to pay lender&rsquo;s mortgage insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>The state you intend to buy in</strong> &ndash; costs like <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/calculators/stamp-duty-calculator"">stamp duty</a> vary from state to state.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional costs</strong> &ndash; Sometimes borrowers take on a higher mortgage to cover the cost of moving, renovating and refurnishing. The calculator captures an estimate of these costs, but it may vary from borrower to borrower.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>TIP</h6>\n<h3>Watch&nbsp;our mortgage guide</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/guide"">Mortgage Guide</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-example"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">What the calculator won&rsquo;t take into account</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>Personal circumstances, like your employment status and existing debt, will affect your ability to get a loan. Lenders risk-assess their borrowers based on their circumstances and their perceived ability to make their repayments in a timely manner. A mortgage repayment calculator does not make a judgement about your ability to make repayments. Therefore, it is best used as a guide only.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>STILL RENTING?</h6>\n<h3>Use the NYT calculator to see if you're ahead.</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0"">RENT VS BUY</a></div>\n</div>\n<h2>What if interest rates change?</h2>\n<p>The interest rate calculator includes a function that will assist you in budgeting for future interest rate rises that may occur. When you choose a <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/variable-rate"">variable rate mortgage</a>, the interest rate is subject to fluctuation that corresponds to the <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate"">cash rate</a> set by the Reserve Bank of Australia each month. This <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate"">cash rate</a> is influenced by many economic factors and has an impact on not only <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/mortgage-rates"">mortgage rates</a> but savings account and term deposit rates as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For housing loan calculator users, being able to see the amount that your repayments will cost if your interest rate changes by different amounts is a great planning tool. It will help you to visualise how a rate hike could impact on your monthly budget and to determine if you would still be able to afford your mortgage should your rate rise. A good rule of thumb is to see if you could still afford your mortgage repayments comfortably if there was to be a 2 per cent rate increase by entering the change into mortgage calculator.</p>\n<p>For refinancers who already hold a mortgage, using the refinancer calculator to see how a potential rate rise could impact their repayments in future could be very useful. This would also allow current borrowers to see how their home loan rate could potentially stack up against the competition if all lenders were to lift rates at once. While it is impossible to predict exactly how each lender would respond to a change in the <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate"">cash rate</a> it is better for borrowers to be prepared and have a good knowledge of the market.</p>\n<h2><strong>How much can I borrow?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you are a looking to purchase a property, it is good to have an idea of how much money you can borrow as this will affect the size of your monthly repayments. Using a calculator to establish the figure of how much can be comfortably borrowed should therefore be one of the first steps in your home loan search. This will provide you with the right figure to enter into the calculator and give you a more accurate representation of your expected monthly repayments.</p>\n<p>Without a realistic idea of how much you can borrow, it is easy to get carried away looking at dream properties that may be unrealistic for your budget. Even some properties that may seem to be at a reasonable price may be unattainable when your other debts and lifestyle factors are considered. This is why using a calculator to determine how much you can borrow before using the home loan calculator will give you a much more accurate picture of your financial situation.</p>\n<p>When looking at the results of the housing loan calculator, where your monthly repayment is listed, use this figure to determine if borrowing this much money will place you in mortgage stress. Mortgage stress is defined as when more than 30 per cent of your monthly pre-tax income is going towards your housing costs, meaning rent or mortgage repayments.</p>\n<p>If the mortgage repayment calculator is showing a figure that will place you in this position it may be advisable to consider borrowing less money or, if possible, finding a lender with a lower interest rate. If this is your solution, keep in mind that interest rates will fluctuate and you should be comfortably able to sustain your mortgage repayments if your rate does begin to rise.</p>\n<p>Use the interest rate calculator to sample what your repayments will look like at higher rates to make sure you can comfortably continue to pay off your loan even if rates do go up.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What about extra repayments?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Depending on your home loan, you may be able to make a fixed or unlimited amount of extra repayments to reduce the amount you owe on the loan faster.</p>\n<p>The mortgage calculator shows you a projection of your repayments without factoring in this variance. If you do foresee yourself making extra repayments on your mortgage you should factor this into the monthly repayment figure shown to you by the home loan calculator.</p>\n<p>The home loan calculator results also can serve as a benchmark to see how much interest you would be paying if you did not make extra repayments.</p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-tip"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">Example</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>Marcus enters into the mortgage calculator that he wants to buy his first property at a value of $500,000. He has a $50,000 deposit that he has saved up and he plans to pay the loan back over a period of 30 years. Using the calculator, Marcus realises that he will be paying his lender a total of $344,664 in interest over the life of the loan. After seeing this figure, he takes some time to work out his monthly budget and finds that if he goes with the lowest rate on offer he could comfortably increase his mortgage repayment from $2,337 a month to $2,387. After doing some sums he realises that this $50 increase a month will reduce the life of his loan by a year and the amount of total interest paid by around $15,000. Marcus thinks this is doable and sets out to look for a loan that allows extra monthly repayments. If the ability to make extra repayments sounds like it will be a deciding factor in your home loan search, then make sure you closely look at the mortgage you choose. Some lenders, particularly for fixed home loans, will cap the amount of extra repayments you can make per year and charge for the privilege to make more. Keep an eye out for this and ask a lender what their policy is on extra repayments before signing up for your home loan of choice. You may be able to find out more using a fixed versus variable calculator.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>What about interest-only home loans?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you are taking out an <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/interest-only-home-loans"">interest-only home loan</a>, the housing loan calculator will still be able to give you an accurate picture of what your monthly repayments will look like at different interest rates. By selecting the interest-only option under loan structure on the home loan calculator you will be presented with results tailored to this type of loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You will notice in the graph that is produced by the calculator that the principal amount will not diminish, as it would in a standard loan, and instead it is only the principal amount that is paid down.</p>\n<p>Interest-only loans are may not be suitable for all borrowers and are generally used by investors who plan to sell the property in the future and are therefore not interested in paying off the principal in the short term. For owner-occupiers, the interest-only loan is something that is usually engaged for a short period of time so that borrowers can take advantage of a lower repayment amount.</p>\n<p>Overall, however, any time spent making interest-only repayments will increase the length of the loan and amount of interest paid.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Using the mortgage repayment calculator, owner-occupiers can switch between the interest-only and principal and interest loan structure to determine the size of their repayments with each type of loan. This can be useful to show how much you stand to save per month, in the short-term at least, if you need to switch to an interest-only loan type for a period of time.</p>\n<p>ASIC&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-apps/interest-only-mortgage-calculator"" rel=""nofollow"">interest only mortgage calculator</a> is another great tool to look at how interest-only payments will affect your loan.</p>\n<h2>What is mortgage stress?</h2>\n<p>If your household is devoting 30 per cent or more of its pre-tax income to mortgage repayments, you&rsquo;re suffering from mortgage stress.</p>\n<p>The last census, which was conducted in 2016, found that about one in five households were suffering from mortgage stress.</p>\n<p>There are three main reasons why households find themselves in mortgage stress:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buying out of their price range</li>\n<li>Earning too little</li>\n<li>Spending too much</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some people make the mistake of assuming that if a bank is willing to help them buy a property, it must mean the home is within their price range and they&rsquo;ll be able to meet the repayments. However, banks aren&rsquo;t infallible. So just because you can qualify for a loan, doesn&rsquo;t mean you can afford it.</p>\n<p>But even if you can afford it at the time, your financial circumstances might change. For example, if you or your partner quit work to have a baby, your household income would fall and your spending would increase. The result might be mortgage stress.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why you should be careful not to be too ambitious when buying a property. You should also make sure you have a cash buffer in case interest rates rise, you lose your job or you suddenly get hit with a large bill.</p>\n<p>You can use the home loan calculator to work out whether a potential loan would place you in mortgage.</p>\n<h2><strong>What&rsquo;s the next step after using a calculator?</strong></h2>\n<p>After the mortgage repayment calculator has told you how much you could expect to pay for your loan in interest and principal, the next step is to compare the range of home loans available on the market and to examine their associated costs and features.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you have developed a short list of lenders and loans, you will need to contact your lenders of choice to negotiate a loan or find a broker to do so on your behalf.</p>\n<h2>The benefits of switching lenders</h2>\n<p>If your lender if offering you a rate among the lowest in the market and you're not paying high ongoing fees, there may be little reason to switch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, if you notice after doing your calculation that there are lower rates on the market, it could be worth considering the benefits of switching to another lender.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RateCity calculations show borrowers could have saved thousands if they switched to a low cost lender in the last 10 years. The below infographic shows what those savings could be used for.</p>\n</div>",,74000,91,1360,1343,247935,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,32644.45,14.0

Gone are the days when you had to traipse around banks and building societies to look for a deal that would best suit your circumstances. Today, there is a lot of advice online when it comes to financial matters, and when you've weighed up some comparisons, you can move ahead with confidence.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What are cheap mortgages?</strong></h2>\n<p>These are financial products that are aimed at providing you with the best mortgage deal available. Many companies will offer cheap mortgages and will be hoping to win your business, but you need to fully understand what your options are. A mortgage is a loan from a company to enable you to perhaps buy your first home or upgrade to a larger property. It can also provide financial backing for an investment in a property that you won't live in but will rent out. There are a number of<span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/best-mortgage""> types of mortgage</a></span>, and it's as well to understand how they differ before making a decision.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Variable interest rate:</em> this type of mortgage means that payments fluctuate, usually in line with what official interest rates for the country are set at. They are popular with owner occupiers, who have a little leeway if interest rates go up and will benefit if lower interest rates are passed on by their lender.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Fixed interest rate:</em> the interest rate you pay is fixed for an agreed period of time between you and the lender. It could be for two or three years or up to ten years. It gives you the security that you know exactly how much you will be paying each month for that given period of time. You won't benefit from a reduction in interest rates, but you will be protected if they rise.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Split interest rate:</em> you can choose, if your lender agrees, a split rate whereby part of your loan is fixed and part is at a variable rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How do cheap mortgages compare with other similar products?</strong></h2>\n<p>When you are researching cheap mortgages, you should bear in mind that there are often terms and conditions you need to check. You may discover what you think is the best deal in terms of interest rates, but you need to understand the small print. Some lenders may not permit you to rent out rooms if it is your primary residence, or allow you to rent the whole property until you have made repayments over an agreed period.</p>\n<h2><strong>What risks and rewards are there with cheap mortgages?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you keep up your repayments, then you will be the proud owner of a property that is likely to have increased in value at the end of the mortgage term. Your home is at risk if you don't keep up the regular repayments, so bear that in mind when you enter into a loan agreement.</p>",,1900,0,0,4,1146,0.6,0.125,0.125,0.75,0.75,2285.0,60.0

To find the cheapest home loans you will need to understand the ways in which different loans work.</p>\n<h3><strong>Identifying the cheapest home loans</strong></h3>\n<p>To find one of the&nbsp;cheapest home loans for you, you will need to consider several different aspects of those available. Sometimes a loan offering low interest rates will entail high fees, meaning that you would be paying more overall than for a loan with a higher rate. Sometimes paying off a loan more quickly will mean spending less overall, even if the interest rate is higher.</p>\n<h3><strong>How your personal circumstances affect what is cheapest</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you take out a loan you need to think carefully about your personal circumstances. This isn&rsquo;t just about avoiding financial difficulties; it&rsquo;s about saving money. For instance, your income will affect the amount of risk you can afford to take, and as a rule higher-risk options are cheaper. You will also need to prioritise between lower monthly payments and a lower overall cost.</p>\n<h3><strong>Low interest rates</strong></h3>\n<p>The first thing people look for when comparing the coast of loans is the basic interest rate. The cheapest rates tend to be on variable rate loans but these will not necessarily stay cheap &ndash; they could rise if the national interest rate rises. Finding a low interest rate is more important if you expect to pay off the loan over a longer period of time. If you plan to pay it off over a shorter term, the interest rate should be lower in your scale of priorities when you&rsquo;re working out which loan is cheapest for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>Low fees</strong></h3>\n<p>Most home loans include fees that you will need to consider when working out the overall cost. These include upfront arrangement fees and ongoing administration fees, which are often charged on an annual basis. Sometimes cashback is available when you are accepted for a loan, which will reduce your costs, but you must always make sure your lender tells you clearly what fees apply.</p>\n<h3><strong>The loan period</strong></h3>\n<p>Many lenders will try to lock you into a specific loan period when offering you what looks like a cheap deal. If you would be capable of paying back the loan more quickly (without placing yourself at financial risk) then this can be a problem. It effectively makes the loan more expensive because even if the monthly charges are lower you&rsquo;ll be paying interest over more months, and this will add up.</p>\n<h3><strong>Money saving features</strong></h3>\n<p>Many loans offer additional features that can save you money if you know what you&rsquo;re doing. An offset account, for instance, can enable you to reduce the overall amount of interest you pay on your loan. The option to make additional payments at no charge means you may be able to save money by paying the loan off more quickly, and loan portability means you won&rsquo;t be hit by extra charges if you move house before the loan period ends.<span class=""s1""></span><span class=""s2"">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=""p3""><em><span class=""s2"">* The phrase&nbsp;&lsquo;one of the cheapest&rsquo; is not a recommendation or rating of products.&nbsp;</span><span class=""s2"">This page compares a range of home loans from selected providers, not all products or providers are included in the comparison.&nbsp;</span><span class=""s1"">No home loan is one size fits all.

There are a great many such home loans out there but finding the cheapest fixed rate home loans can be a challenge. This is partly because the cheapest loan for one person may not be the cheapest for another. To get a good deal, you will need to find the right loan for your particular financial circumstances.</p>\n<h3><strong>Comparing home loans</strong></h3>\n<p>With so many fixed rate loans on the market, how should you go about comparing them? The obvious answer is to look at the interest rates advertised by their providers, but these can present a misleading picture. That&rsquo;s because many loans with low interest rates have high annual fees or other attendant costs that mean you end up paying more. To avoid getting caught out like this, use the comparison rate. The law says that every lender has to calculate this in the same way and it covers most types of fee as well as interest, so it makes it much easier for you to identify the best deals.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to find the cheapest loan from the available options</strong></h3>\n<p>There are several factors you need to take into account to find the cheapest loan. Low interest rates may not save you money overall if you&rsquo;re obliged to sign up to a lengthy loan term. Because you won&rsquo;t be able to enjoy lower rates when the RBA cash&nbsp;rate falls, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure that you fix your rates at a good time, so it&rsquo;s worth keeping a close eye on national economics in order to make sure you pick the right moment. Because switching lender usually entails high charges for fixed rate borrowers, you will need to get it right first time.</p>\n<h3><strong>The value of security</strong></h3>\n<p>Although variable rate home loans often offer cheaper rates than fixed rate loans, the latter really pay off when it comes to security. That&rsquo;s because you won&rsquo;t have to worry about your payments increasing if the national interest rate rises. This could not only save you money directly &ndash; it can help you make money. You won&rsquo;t need to keep easily accessible savings on hand in case your payments rise, so if you have extra money that you don&rsquo;t immediately need, you&rsquo;re free to invest it. If you make good investment choices this can easily compensate for the difference in rates.</p>\n<h3><strong>Pros and cons</strong></h3>\n<p>There are good and bad things about choosing a fixed rate home loan, even if you get a very cheap deal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No rate rises &ndash; you can predict exactly what you&rsquo;ll have to pay;</li>\n<li>A simple arrangement that&rsquo;s easy to keep track of;</li>\n<li>Easy budgeting gives you more control over your money;</li>\n<li>Few, if any, extra features;</li>\n<li>Unlikely to offer free early repayments;</li>\n<li>Higher fees if you want to end the arrangement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*<em>This article doesn't serve as a recommendation of any product, nor does it compare all products.&nbsp;</em></p>",,5,0,19,11,408,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,45.800000000000004,270.0

Other borrowers may want a range of features, like offset accounts, redraw facilities and flexible repayment schedules, but that may cost a little more in interest and fees.</p>\n<p>Once you've prepared your preferences, you can&nbsp;use these to filter your list of potential home loan options when making your&nbsp;mortgage comparison. Start by&nbsp;entering how much you want to borrow for the property of your choice. You&rsquo;ll then be asked how much you have available for your deposit. Lenders generally favour borrowers with higher deposits because it reduces the risk on their side, so <span>higher deposits often expand your search results when comparing home loans</span>. If you have a deposit below 20%, you may be required to pay Lender&rsquo;s Mortgage Insurance (LMI).</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">WILL YOU NEED TO PAY LMI?</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">LMI Calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""https://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/lmi-calculator"">Calculate</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Once you've entered your loan amount details, you have the option to select your loan term. The most common loan term for both owner-occupiers and investors is 30 years, but some borrowers opt for shorter loan terms depending on their circumstances. A few lenders also give you the option to borrow for terms of up to 45 years.</p>\n<p>The next step when comparing home loans is to select what type of borrower you are. Again, this will determine the best home loan rates for which you are eligible. Since a crackdown from the prudential regulator in 2015, lenders have been limiting investment lending through a number of measures, one of which is by charging slightly higher home loan rates. A quick <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan comparison</a> will show that as an investor you may be charged up to a percentage point more than an owner-occupier.</p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-tip"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">Example: Finding a low rate investment loan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>Roy is a first-time investor who wants the lowest rate on offer in the home loan market.

High fees on a home loan can negate the impact of a low interest rate, so they should always be considered.</p>\n<p>Some of the fees you&rsquo;re likely to encounter during your mortgage comparison&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Upfront fees</strong> &ndash; These are the fees the lender will charge when you establish your loan. They sometimes include establishment fees, conveyancing fees, <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/calculators/stamp-duty-calculator"">stamp duty</a> and Lender&rsquo;s Mortgage Insurance (LMI). Upfront fees vary significantly between lenders.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing fees</strong> &ndash; These are the fees your lender charges either monthly or yearly for the upkeep of your loan.</li>\n<li><strong>Redraw fees </strong>&ndash; If you choose a loan with a redraw facility, sometimes those redraws attract a fee. This can be important to know for your budgeting.</li>\n<li><strong>Discharge fees </strong>&ndash; At the conclusion of your loan, your lender may&nbsp;charge you a termination fee.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-example"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">Example: Flexibility seals the deal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>Louise already has a home loan, but it doesn&rsquo;t give her many benefits.

A low documentation loan is for borrowers who do not have the traditional records required to secure a loan, like an employment history or clean credit history.

The easiest way to figure that out is to make a <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan comparison</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;selecting a series of home loan products and looking at&nbsp;them side by side to see which ones come out ahead, both in terms of the current home loan&nbsp;rates, and the features and benefits they offer.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>How to compare home loans</strong></h3>\n<p>Before you start your <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan comparison</a> journey with RateCity, it can be helpful to work out&nbsp;exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for from a mortgage. Some borrowers <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">compare home loans</a> looking for&nbsp;the lowest possible repayment rate, but that often comes at the cost of flexibility. Other borrowers may want a range of features, like offset accounts, redraw facilities and flexible repayment schedules, but that may cost a little more in interest and fees.</p>\n<p>Once you've prepared your preferences, you can&nbsp;use these to filter your list of potential home loan options when making your&nbsp;mortgage comparison. Start by&nbsp;entering how much you want to borrow for the property of your choice. You&rsquo;ll then be asked how much you have available for your deposit. Lenders generally favour borrowers with higher deposits because it reduces the risk on their side, so <span>higher deposits often expand your search results when comparing home loans</span>. If you have a deposit below 20%, you may be required to pay Lender&rsquo;s Mortgage Insurance (LMI).</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">WILL YOU NEED TO PAY LMI?</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">LMI Calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""https://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/lmi-calculator"">Calculate</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Once you've entered your loan amount details, you have the option to select your loan term. The most common loan term for both owner-occupiers and investors is 30 years, but some borrowers opt for shorter loan terms depending on their circumstances. A few lenders also give you the option to borrow for terms of up to 45 years.</p>\n<p>The next step when comparing home loans is to select what type of borrower you are. Again, this will determine the best home loan rates for which you are eligible. Since a crackdown from the prudential regulator in 2015, lenders have been limiting investment lending through a number of measures, one of which is by charging slightly higher home loan rates. A quick <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan comparison</a> will show that as an investor you may be charged up to a percentage point more than an owner-occupier.</p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-tip"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">Example: Finding a low rate investment loan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>Roy is a first-time investor who wants the lowest rate on offer in the home loan market.

He discovers that there are at least five lenders on RateCity that can shave up to $80 a month off what&nbsp;his bank offered, with interest rates below 4.2%. Over 30 years, that&rsquo;s a significant saving.</p>\n<p>Roy decides one of the loans on offer looks more compelling than the other loans available, due to its low rate and low fees.

A fixed home&nbsp;loan secures your interest rate, which means for the term&nbsp;of your loan, there will be no changes to your repayments, even if the Reserve Bank&rsquo;s official <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate"">cash rate</a> changes. On the other hand, a <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/variable-rate"">variable rate</a> loan may change when the official <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate"">cash rate</a> does. If the <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate"">cash rate</a> is on a downward trend, this could mean extra savings for you if your lender passes on the rate cut, but the opposite is true if the <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate"">cash rate</a>&nbsp;trends upwards. Some borrowers also choose to split their rate between fixed and variable to lock in a bit of certainty, while making the most of a cheap market.</p>\n<div style=""width: 100% , height:100%;""><span style=""width: 100%; min-height: 380px;"" class=""mce-preview-object mce-object-iframe"" contenteditable=""false"" data-mce-object=""iframe"" data-mce-p-src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_fm2LNA8O4""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_fm2LNA8O4"" width=""300"" height=""150""></iframe><span class=""mce-shim""></span></span></div>\n<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll be asked whether you&rsquo;d like to make&nbsp;principal and interest repayments or interest-only repayments. Principal and interest repayments allow you to pay off the amount you&rsquo;ve borrowed along with the interest charges. However, some lenders allow you to delay paying your loan's principal for a set period of time and simply pay the interest.</p>\n<h3><strong>Select your features</strong></h3>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve chosen your type of loan and repayments, RateCity's <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan comparison</a> tool will give you the option to show only loans with some popular home loan features, such as an offset account, a redraw facility and extra repayments.</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">Offset Accounts and Redraw Facilities</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""https://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/guide#Offset accounts and redraw facilities"">Learn More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>An offset account allows you to offset the interest you pay with a separate, but linked account, while a redraw facility lets you redraw any&nbsp;extra <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">home loan repayments</a> you&rsquo;ve made if you need that money back in your pocket. Some lenders also allow you to make extra repayments if you have a good month or receive a one-off windfall, which can help to pay off your loan quickly.</p>\n<h3><strong>Choose your fees</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the benefits when you <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">compare home loans</a> with a financial comparison website like RateCity.com.au is that as well as looking at the home loan interest rate, you can compare fees. High fees on a home loan can negate the impact of a low interest rate, so they should always be considered.</p>\n<p>Some of the fees you&rsquo;re likely to encounter during your mortgage comparison&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Upfront fees</strong> &ndash; These are the fees the lender will charge when you establish your loan. They sometimes include establishment fees, conveyancing fees, <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/calculators/stamp-duty-calculator"">stamp duty</a> and Lender&rsquo;s Mortgage Insurance (LMI). Upfront fees vary significantly between lenders.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing fees</strong> &ndash; These are the fees your lender charges either monthly or yearly for the upkeep of your loan.</li>\n<li><strong>Redraw fees </strong>&ndash; If you choose a loan with a redraw facility, sometimes those redraws attract a fee. This can be important to know for your budgeting.</li>\n<li><strong>Discharge fees </strong>&ndash; At the conclusion of your loan, your lender may&nbsp;charge you a termination fee.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-example"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">Example: Flexibility seals the deal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>Louise already has a home loan, but it doesn&rsquo;t give her many benefits.

You may expect that when you come to buy a property, you'll either buy one that has been lived in or buy one off-plan from a housing developer. If you're imaginative and prepared to take a few risks, you could as an alternative build your own home with the assistance of construction loans.</p>\n<h2>What is a construction loan?</h2>\n<p>In simple terms, it's a loan that you can use to pay for the cost of building your new home. It's usually a short-term loan and can be offered for a specific amount of time &ndash; generally around a year &ndash; giving you the time that you need to complete the build. When the build is finished, you'll have to pay off the construction loan by taking out a new loan, often known as the ""end loan."" That means you'll need to refinance at the end of the construction loan term, and many people have a standard mortgage at a fixed or variable rate to move things forward.</p>\n<h2>How does a construction loan compare to other similar products?</h2>\n<p>You need to look at rates, which are likely to be more expensive than an ordinary mortgage. That's because the lender doesn't have a tangible asset, just something that is expected to be constructed. It's hard for a lender to value this, and so if property prices in the neighbourhood fall or the builder doesn't do a good job, the lender could suffer from a poor investment. Banks and other financial institutions may be wary of lending for this type of loan, so you need to work on giving your potential lender confidence that the project will be successful.</p>\n<h2>What are the main features that you need to consider for a construction loan?</h2>\n<p>You need to know that you can afford it &ndash; you may only pay interest on the sums that a builder draws down from the loan, but you need to know that you can refinance at the end of your project and afford those payments. Your lender will want the involvement of a qualified builder and be provided with detailed specifications for the building, including what materials will be used, and a timescale. Expect to put down quite a large deposit as lenders will want to see that you are investing in the project as well as them. A good credit rating will help when lenders are weighing up whether or not to support you.</p>\n<h2>Are there serious risks?</h2>\n<p>There can be if you're not meticulously organised. Timescales frequently slip for construction projects, sometimes due to poor weather conditions, sometimes due to a builder not adhering to the project timetable. Delays can cost you money, so you need to tie everything up contractually as tightly as you can, including penalty clauses for delays. Make sure that the plans for the building are accurate and what you want, and take the time to discuss these in detail with your builder, and ensure that the lender also has them. Your reward at the end? Your own home, exactly how you want it, and a great asset for the future.</p>",,1300,130,1000,1078,26700,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,3176.7,50.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong>Home loans in Darwin</strong></h1>\n<p>Darwin, the capital city of the most sparsely populated state, is not the most popular of the capital cities in Australia. Having said that,&nbsp;it is nevertheless attractive for some property owners and investors. Like many smaller metropolitan cities, Darwin&rsquo;s economy is heavily dependent on external economic factors from both national and international events and influences. These external factors also have a large impact on the property and rental markets more than some other cities, with prices and demand falling when the city&rsquo;s economy falters.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What do I need to know about Darwin?</strong></h2>\n<p>Like the rest of the Northern Territory, Darwin&rsquo;s economy is built upon the mining and tourism industries. The region offers rich natural, military and historic sites for visitors to enjoy. The city is built on a bluff that overlooks the harbour and the Timor Sea, and is more spread out than many other metropolitan areas. The city has strong Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander roots with the region being the ancestral home of the Larrakia people. There are many indigenous landmarks and ceremonial grounds in the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the property market and Darwin economy&nbsp;like?</strong></h2>\n<p>With the mining and tourism industries potentially more volatile and susceptible to external factors, the property market and economy of Darwin does tend to fluctuate in line with the health of those industries. However, a military base within Darwin as well as other parts of the state does provide stable employment and industry in the area. Financial input from the Federal government also bolsters the economy of Darwin. Several parts of the city are generally always in demand from property buyers, such as the suburbs on the coast, while those properties further east tend to be more affordable. Tenancies are generally stable with rental prices on par with similar cities. Because of this, investors generally find the city attractive for development and building projects.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Why should I get a home loan in Darwin?</strong></h2>\n<p>Basically - affordability. On average, the city&rsquo;s properties are less expensive than in many other Australian cities. With the mining and defence industries based in Darwin, investment properties will also generally be lucrative with high tenancy rates and stable rental returns. In addition, the fees and costs for obtaining a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan</a> in Darwin are similar if not the same as obtaining a home loan in another state or city in Australia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Are there any potential problems with getting a home loan in Darwin?</strong></h2>\n<p>More than any other capital city, Darwin is very susceptible to extreme weather events and natural disasters. The city has been severely damaged several times after being hit by cyclones, strong winds and monsoon rain. Some suburbs are more at risk than others, with properties on the coast being vulnerable to flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Are there any laws or regulations I should be aware of?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Northern Territory government maintains most of the taxes and duties paid when organising a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">home loan</a>. You may also have to consult native title laws depending on the type of property you are considering purchasing or if you are choosing to build. These include stamp duty and land taxes. The Darwin City Council regulates many parts of the building process and this will be relevant if you are building or planning on making major renovations. You should consult the council before purchasing or making structural changes to a property.</p>",,20,0,8,7,1554,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,159.65,193.0

But you can ease the pain by snaring a special home loan deal.</p>\n<p>Many people don&rsquo;t realise that banks, credit unions, building societies and non-bank lenders frequently offer short-term home loan deals.</p>\n<p>Why? It&rsquo;s because the mortgage market is so competitive, with more than one hundred lenders offering several thousand products. Given how crowded the market is, lenders often feel like the only way they can get people&rsquo;s attention is to entice them with home loan deals.</p>\n<p>To put it another way, some lenders are so hungry to sign on new customers that they will literally buy your business.</p>\n<h3>All lenders play the game</h3>\n<p>Some people might assume that only smaller lenders would resort to offering home loan deals.</p>\n<p>However, that&rsquo;s not the case. Even the big four banks &ndash; ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac &ndash; which dominate the mortgage market, feel like they need to play the specials game.</p>\n<p>That highlights just how competitive Australia&rsquo;s home loan industry has become.</p>\n<p>There are always home loan deals available, if you know where to look.</p>\n<h3>Different types of home loan deals</h3>\n<p>Not all home loan deals are created equal. Of course, some are more generous than others. But they can also be structured very differently.</p>\n<p>Here are the five main types of home loan deal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Rate cuts</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lenders might try to entice you by offering you a reduced home loan rate. This might be a temporary reduction that is withdrawn after, say, one or two years, or a permanent reduction that applies for the life of the loan.</p>\n<ol start=""2"">\n<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Fee reductions</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lenders might also promise to reduce or eliminate certain fees if you sign up for a mortgage. This might save you up to $1,000.</p>\n<ol start=""3"">\n<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Cashback offers</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some lenders hand out rebates, which can be worth more than $1,000. Borrowers can use this money to help pay for any establishment fees, valuation fees, settlement fees, legal fees and lenders&rsquo; mortgage insurance charges.</p>\n<ol start=""4"">\n<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Rewards points</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other lenders hand out credit card rewards points, which can also be worth more than $1,000.</p>\n<ol start=""5"">\n<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Gifts</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The other popular type of home loan deal is sign-on gifts. These can include EFTPOS cards, iPads, shopping vouchers and even holidays.</p>\n<h3>Conditions always apply</h3>\n<p>There are two important points to remember when it comes to home loan deals. First, you don&rsquo;t get something for nothing, so you might have to &lsquo;pay&rsquo; for a lower rate with higher fees, or you might have to &lsquo;pay&rsquo; for a free gift with less flexible repayment terms.</p>\n<p>Second, conditions always apply for home loan deals. The most common condition is that you have to be a new customer (as opposed to an existing customer moving from one of the lender&rsquo;s products to another). Other conditions might include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your loan needs to be of a certain value &ndash; e.g. more than $300,000 or less than $750,000</li>\n<li>Your loan needs to be of a certain type &ndash; e.g. investment</li>\n<li>Your loan needs to have a certain structure &ndash; e.g. principal and interest</li>\n<li>Your loan needs to have a certain loan-to-value ratio (LVR) &ndash; e.g. no higher than 80 per cent or between 50 and 70 per cent</li>\n<li>Your loan needs to be bundled with other products &ndash; e.g. a credit card or savings account</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>A regular offer can beat a special deal</h3>\n<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s planning to take out a mortgage or who is thinking about refinancing should be on the lookout for home loan deals.</p>\n<p>However, it would be a mistake to assume that one lender&rsquo;s special deal must always be better than another lender&rsquo;s regular offer.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of credible lower-profile lenders out there that regularly outperform higher-profile lenders in terms of price and service &ndash; even when those rivals have special deals.</p>\n<p>So once you&rsquo;ve explored RateCity&rsquo;s home loan deals page, you should also visit RateCity&rsquo;s <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">home loan comparison page</a></span>. This is a place where you can check out almost 4,000 loans, comparing them in terms of interest rate, fees, features and minimum deposit. You can also take advantage of RateCity&rsquo;s <span><a href=""https://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/real-time-ratings"">Real Time Ratings&trade; tool</a></span>, which offers a personalised home loan ranking calculated just for you.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done that, you might discover a regular offer that is superior to any of the short-term home loan deals.</p>\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for a better deal</h3>\n<p>Borrowers and refinancers shouldn&rsquo;t just be on the lookout for existing home loan deals &ndash; they should also try to manufacture their own.</p>\n<p>Many Australians don&rsquo;t realise that lenders will often hand out spontaneous home loan deals &ndash; provided you ask.</p>\n<p>Why? It&rsquo;s because the mortgage market is so competitive. If lenders think you might take your business elsewhere, there&rsquo;s a chance they&rsquo;ll sweeten an existing deal by offering you any combination of rate cuts, fee reductions, cashback offers, rewards points and gifts.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t let these lenders pressure you into accepting spontaneous home loan deals on the spot. You should ask for the deal in writing and say you&rsquo;d like time to discuss it with your family. Alarm bells should ring if the lender insists that this is a now-or-never offer. That could be a sign that the lender expects that you&rsquo;re going to shop around &ndash; and find a superior offer. The lender should have no problem with giving you time if it&rsquo;s confident about the quality of its offer.</p>\n<p>Another point worth mentioning is that you shouldn&rsquo;t feel embarrassed about asking a lender to give you a better deal. Lenders get asked this question all the time; it might feel strange to you but it&rsquo;s standard for them. The worst that can happen is that the lender says no.</p>",,140,3,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,15.5,349.0

Most home loan providers offer the ability to make extra repayments on a home loan. However, many come with restrictions as to the extra amount you can pay or are only attached to variable interest rate home loans. It is always important to <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare""><span>compare</span></a> home loans and check the extra fees or charges and the restrictions before agreeing to take up the home loan.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do extra repayments work?</strong></h2>\n<p>Making extra repayments means paying more funds into your home loan account than the minimal repayments stipulated by your home loan provider. This is the easiest way to reduce interest paid on the loan and is often recommended as the most financially responsible if you have disposable cash in your savings account. Extra repayments can be made in irregular lump sum amounts or regular amounts above the minimum monthly repayment. How you proceed will depend on your personal financial position and what your home loan provider allows.</p>\n<h2><strong>Do all home loans have the facility to make extra repayments?</strong></h2>\n<p>The ability to make extra repayments mostly goes hand in hand with some variable interest rate home loans. In saying this, several providers do have fixed interest rate home loans but they often come with extra fees, charges or increased interest rates. They may also come with restrictions, with only a limited amount of extra repayments being allowed per year. It is always important to weigh up via a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator""><span>mortgage calculator</span></a> whether it would be more beneficial for you to make extra repayments or to have added expenses on the loan. Plus, home loan providers may also remove other payment options to include the extra repayment option on fixed interest and variable interest loans. Some features, such as, redraw facility or offset accounts may not be available to you.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Why should I make extra repayments?</strong></h2>\n<p>Even if it just an extra $50 a month, putting extra repayments into a home loan is the best way to save money in the long term and reduce the life of the home loan. Also, having the home loan paid off sooner decreases the financial burden of retirement. Making the effort to arrange extra repayments into a home loan may also promote budgeting behaviours in all parts of your life, making your financial position better overall.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Are there fees and charges for making extra repayments?</strong></h2>\n<p>Your chosen home loan provider should specify any additional fees and charges for making extra repayments. Many variable interest rate loans or fixed rate loans with higher rates of interest will offer the service without the added cost as an incentive. Many providers also have restrictions on the amount you can repay over the minimum amount, and if you go over this you may be charged. Also, watch out for early repayment fees and early exit fees if you end up paying before you need to or if you terminate your home loan early by paying off the balance.</p>",,100,0,0,0,333,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,43.300000000000004,274.0

It's a big step, especially if you've been used to living with your parents, renting rooms when at university, or renting when you are working.</p>\n<p>Still, you'll be used to paying money for a home you don't own, so why not put your money towards your own home, which is likely to increase in value over the years?&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here comes the concept of first home loan.</span></p>\n<h2>What is a first home loan?</h2>\n<p>When you make the decision to buy your first home, the chances are you're going to need to borrow the money to do it. This is where a <strong>first home loan</strong> can be explored with a range of lenders so that you can get a mortgage for your chosen property. In simple terms, a lender will <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">provide you first home loan</span> to buy your first home, provided you fulfill certain conditions. These will vary, as all lenders are different, but you should expect to <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/low-deposit-home-loans"">pay a deposit before a mortgage</a> company will agree to advance the money you need. How large a percentage of the overall price that deposit will depends on the lender, but expect to save up for a while so that you can put down the requested deposit.<br /><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Want to compare different first home loan products?</span></p>\n<h2>How does a first home buyer loan compare to other products?</h2>\n<p>A first home loan is realistically the only chance <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">for you as a buyer</span> to get onto the property ladder. There are many other buyer loan options available but rarely for the size of this type of purchase. First home loans are, in general, much cheaper in terms of the interest rate charged as opposed to other forms of loan. Mortgage companies want to encourage you to buy your own property and will often offer very reasonable deals. You could fix an interest rate for a period of time maybe several years, enabling you to plan your finance during that time without getting a variable fluctuation if interest rates rise.</p>\n<h2>What are the main features of a first home loan?</h2>\n<p>When a lender agrees to loan you money for your property purchase, you will sign up to the company's terms and conditions. This may relate to whether or not you can rent the property to someone else at some stage, the regulations regarding the interest rate you will pay, insurances you will require for the building (insuring contents is usually your choice, but it&rsquo;s sensible to do), and setting up your regular monthly payment. It's a good idea to check all the requirements carefully as a buyer so that you know exactly what type of contract you are taking on.</p>\n<h2>Are there risks to consider?</h2>\n<p>Yes, but there are also potential rewards. Risks <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">for first home buyer loan</span> include interest rates going up, and if you're on a variable rate, you'll need to source more money every month. If you lose your job and get another one that pays less initially, you could be financially stretched. But if all goes well, your property is likely to increase in value with time and, when you come to sell, net you a tidy profit.</p>",,170,130,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,82.0,235.5

By fixing your interest rate in advance, you&rsquo;ll know just how much your mortgage repayments will cost from month to month for the duration of the fixed term, which can help to simplify your budget. Even if your lender starts raising its variable interest rates in response to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raising the official cash rate, your home loan&rsquo;s fixed repayments will remain just as affordable for the time being.</span></p>\n<p><span>On the other hand, if the RBA cuts the cash rate, your lender won&rsquo;t pass this cut on to your fixed rate home loan &ndash; you&rsquo;ll still be making interest payments at the same rate until the fixed term ends. <br /> </span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>Everything you need to know about the RBA cash rate</h6>\n<h3>RBA Cash Rate Tracker</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s also worth keeping in mind that most interest rates can only be fixed for a limited number of years, and afterwards will revert to the lender&rsquo;s standard variable rate.

But it&rsquo;s also important to think about the overall length of your home loan&rsquo;s term, as this can affect how much interest you&rsquo;ll pay in total over the lifetime of the loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>Most mortgages start with a term of 25 or 30 years, though shorter and longer options are also available. If you choose a shorter home loan, you&rsquo;ll make a smaller number of repayments, each one for a larger percentage of the loan&rsquo;s principal. While this may make the monthly repayments less affordable, fewer repayments also means fewer interest charges, so you&rsquo;ll pay less interest in total over the lifetime of the loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>Conversely, stretching out your home loan over a longer term means making more repayments, each one for a smaller percentage of the principal. While each of these repayments may be more affordable from month to month, you&rsquo;ll find yourself being charged interest a greater number of times, and may ultimately end up paying more in total interest than if you&rsquo;d opted for the shorter loan term.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>Enter your term length and&nbsp;calculate your mortgage repayments</h6>\n<h3>Home Loan Calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">Start Calculating</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><span>Fixed rate home loans for different buyers</span></h3>\n<p style=""text-align: center;""><span><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161028102047/first-home-buyers-resized-compressor.jpg""><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-55727"" alt=""first-home-buyers-resized-compressor"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161028102047/first-home-buyers-resized-compressor.jpg"" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span>First Home Buyers often find the security of fixed rate home loans appealing, as the stability they provide over the first few years of a mortgage can help borrowers keep their finances under control while they build up their equity. Some lenders provide special discounted rates as an introductory offer for their mortgages, though borrowers should remember that when these &ldquo;honeymoon rates&rdquo; expire, they will revert to the lender&rsquo;s standard rates &ndash; be sure to budget accordingly!</span></p>\n<p><span>Investors can also find the stability of fixed rate home loans useful, as they can help to keep the loan&rsquo;s repayments from increasing beyond the property&rsquo;s rental income during the fixed period, and ensure a steady stream of income from the investment.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>Which interest rate is right for you?</h6>\n<h3>The fixed versus variable home loan debate</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/articles/the-fixed-versus-variable-home-loan-debate"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>Refinancing a mortgage onto a lower interest rate can help to reduce your repayments and provide additional affordability. If your lender allows you to do so, fixing this interest rate for a few years can let you keep enjoying this added affordability for longer. This can be good news for both investors and owner occupiers, especially those who are buying their next home.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Offset accounts and redraw facilities</span></h3>\n<p><span>Fixing the interest rate on a home loan can often also mean agreeing to a fixed repayment plan, where you&rsquo;re expected to pay back your loan on a predetermined schedule for the duration of the fixed rate period. This may put restrictions on your ability to pay extra money onto your mortgage and get ahead on your repayments, even if the money becomes available from a tax refund, a work bonus, or even a statistically-improbable lottery win. </span></p>\n<p><span>But some lenders allow borrowers to freely make extra repayments onto their fixed rate home loans, and a few even offer some additional features to help provide further financial flexibility. </span></p>\n<p><span>A redraw facility will allow you to withdraw the surplus balance from your home loan when you get ahead on your repayments, subject to your lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. This means that if you have spare savings available, you can pay them onto your mortgage and bring you closer to making an early exit from the loan, confident that you&rsquo;ll still be able to put this money back in your pocket again in case of emergency. </span></p>\n<p><span>An offset account works just like a regular savings or transaction account, but with one major difference &ndash; it&rsquo;s linked to your mortgage. Whatever money you pay into an offset account is included when your lender calculates its interest charges. </span></p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-example"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">Example</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>If you have <strong>$15,000</strong> in your offset account, and have paid back <strong>$200,000</strong> of a <strong>$500,000</strong> loan, you&rsquo;ll only be charged interest on <strong>$285,000</strong>, rather than <strong>$300,000</strong>, saving you a bit of money.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><span></span><span>Compare fixed rate home loans</span></h3>\n<p><span>With a variety of fixed rate home loan options available to choose from, what is the best way to make your mortgage decision?

An offset account in particular can be useful for reducing the amount of interest paid over the life of your loan. The funds you hold in your offset account are offset against the balance owing on your loan, making such an account a valuable money saving feature.</p>\n<h3>How do fixed rate home loans with 100 per cent offset accounts work?</h3>\n<p>Just like a regular bank account, your offset account can be used for paying in your salary and any other income you receive. To access the funds in your account you&rsquo;ll most likely have a debit card so the offset account functions just like a normal transaction account. The difference with fixed rate home loans with 100 per cent offset accounts, is that when it comes time to calculate the interest on your loan, the money in your offset account is taken into consideration, actively reducing the loan amount on which you have to pay interest.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features?</h3>\n<p>With a fixed rate home loan you will have agreed an interest rate with your lender and a fixed term for which this applies. This term can be anything from one to five years, and the amount of time that you fix the loan for will be dependent on your personal financial circumstances.</p>\n<p>Once you open your offset transaction account linked to your home loan at 100 per cent you are effectively allowing all the funds contained in your account to offset the loan amount, thereby reducing your interest payments.</p>\n<p>When choosing between the available options you should pay attention to fees, fixed terms and any extra features your lender may offer. Both upfront and ongoing fees may apply so be vigilant, and when agreeing terms consider how your financial situation may change before you commit to a lock in for an extended time period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your lender offers discounts or redraw facilities, where you can reclaim any overpayments you may have made, consider if these might be advantageous in the future.</p>\n<h3>What are the risks and rewards?</h3>\n<p>During the fixed period you will have the security of fixed payments even if interest rates should rise. Your offset account balance will reduce your principal loan amount (as long as it is in credit) and this will actively help you to reduce the amount of interest you pay.</p>\n<p>Conversely, if you wish to refinance during the fixed rate period you risk incurring additional costs, which could be expensive and may mean you could lose out if the Reserve Bank of Australia cuts interest rates. Also bear in mind that some offset accounts charge extra fees for the offset facility, so you should always check carefully exactly what you&rsquo;ll be paying for and whether this is likely to adversely affect any savings.</p>",,70,24,169,128,1822,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,245.75,173.0

This helps you stick to a budget and also encourages you to take advantage of any change in circumstances that may free up additional income.</p>\n<h3>How do fixed rate home loans that allow additional repayments work?</h3>\n<p>Fixed rate home loans that allow additional repayments are very much like standard fixed rate loans. The factor that makes them different is that they allow extra repayments to be made. Often the lender will set a limit to the amount of additional payments that can be made before a charge will be incurred. The same may be true should you repay the fixed rate loan in full too early, so it&rsquo;s worth taking the time to fully understand the terms that apply to the loan, including any restrictions and fees.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features?</h3>\n<p>There are three features you should pay attention to when searching for a fixed rate home loan that allows additional payments. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees &ndash; you will want to keep these as low as possible so check whether extra fees apply when you make additional repayments or use other features of the loan. Some fees may be one off and others ongoing so make sure you know what will apply and when.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed terms &ndash; you should be able to source a loan with a term that works for you and your personal circumstances. This could be anything between one and five years, so shop around until you locate a suitable product that will allow you to secure your loan for the period of time you want.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Interest rates &ndash; just as you want to keep fees to a minimum so should you look for the most advantageous interest rates, particularly if you opt for a five-year locked in fixed rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the risks and rewards?</h3>\n<p>The fixed interest rate on the home loan will help you to budget precisely for the initial period of the loan. This is ideal if, for example, you are a first time homebuyer. The chance to make additional repayments can help you to reduce the cost of your loan, and also help you to repay the loan back quicker. If you are able to find a good, competitive fixed rate that you are eligible for you can be locked in to that rate for up to five years. This allows you to take advantage of a healthy period of protection against interest rate rises.</p>\n<p>Remember that with some loans the amount of additional repayments that you can make may be limited. Fees may also be charged for extra repayments, or if you pay your loan back earlier than the set fixed term. Although a fixed rate can be beneficial, if the Reserve Bank of Australia cuts interest rates you might turn out to be paying interest at a higher level than the standard variable loans.</p>",,5,0,0,0,12,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.7000000000000002,486.5

Unsurprisingly most lenders are wary of taking an extra risk by lending to someone who has a history of defaulting on loans or similar financial transgressions. Fixed rate bad credit home loans are designed specifically to help people who have a poor credit rating. They aim to assist you to budget more easily so you can finance purchases to refurbish or to build your own home.</p>\n<p><strong>Why opt for fixed rate bad credit home loans?</strong></p>\n<p><span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/fixed-rate-bad-credit"">Fixed rate bad credit home loans</a></span> have a fixed interest rate for a certain period. Sometimes these home loans have a higher rate of interest and higher annual fees than other loans due to the increased risk of lending to someone with a poor credit record. Mainstream lenders are often unwilling to lend to those with a bad credit history and in this case, you may need to turn to specialist lenders who have a more flexible approach. Lenders selling bad credit home loans offer mortgages to people who are a known credit risk.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the main choices for fixed rate bad credit home loans?</strong></p>\n<p>Besides higher fees and interest rates, you may find that the amount you can borrow is restricted by the lender, often based on the ratio of the loan amount requested to the value of your property. You are likely to need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supply evidence of regular income as proof that you can manage your funds</li>\n<li>Declare all your outstanding debts</li>\n<li>Pay stamp duty and all processing fees</li>\n<li>Raise a deposit equivalent to at least 20 per cent of the loan value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What are the significant loan features?</strong></p>\n<p>Even with a less than perfect credit history you should still look for favourable loan terms including affordable repayments. Check that the frequency of repayments suits how you organise your finances and whether you will have access to an offset account or a redraw facility.</p>\n<p>Although higher fees are to be expected you should still shop around and compare fees on a number of different bad credit home loans until you decide which is the most competitive. If possible seek out an understanding lender to help you get the best possible fixed rate and save money.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the rewards and risks?</strong></p>\n<p>The downside of the bad credit home loan is the higher fees and interest rates you will be charged. This can include higher exit fees should you wish to pay the loan off before the term ends.</p>\n<p>The upside is the increased flexibility applied to the criteria for lending, your protection from fluctuating interest rates and your improved ability to plan your budget. In the longer term, as long as you stick to the loan agreement and make your repayments in full and on time, your credit rating will definitely benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>",,600,0,0,1,191,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,79.25,239.0

Investigating and comparing the different types of loans offered by lenders will help you become fully informed about the market.</p>\n<p>Interest only fixed rate home loans are a very specific type of mortgage that may be good for first time investors looking to negatively gear a property and control monthly outgoing costs or owner-occupier borrowers looking to keep costs down in the early days of the loan.</p>\n<h3>What are fixed rate interest only home loans?</h3>\n<p>When you take out a standard home loan you repay it with interest. This means that you repay a portion of the principal loan amount plus interest charged by the lender. With an interest only home loan, your repayments will normally be lower because you will only be paying the interest and not be repaying any of the prinicpal sum you originally borrowed. A fixed rate interest only home loan takes this arrangement a step further because the rate of interest will not change during the loan period, allowing you to budget precisely for your outgoings.</p>\n<h3>When are fixed rate interest only home loans useful?</h3>\n<p>In most cases interest only home loans, whether at variable or fixed rates, are only available for short periods of time. This is because while you&rsquo;re only paying the interest you&rsquo;re not actually purchasing your home. That only happens when you start to repay part of the sum you borrowed as well as the interest. If you&rsquo;re investing in a property that you plan to sell after a short period of time, fixed rate interest only home loans could work well for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are some features of interest only fixed loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are some main features that you should be aware of if you are thinking of applying for a fixed rate interest only home loan.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The maximum amount the lender is prepared to offer and over what period of time is essential to budget and plan accordingly. Make sure you are clear about the lender&rsquo;s permitted level of loan to value ratio (LVR). This is a calculation of how the amount you are borrowing compares with the value of your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Redraw facilities allow you to reclaim funds if you have made extra payments previously. Always check whether your lender makes a charge for this facility or sets an amount to access as a minimum.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Offset accounts are transaction accounts that may be linked to your home loan. The funds in your linked account could be used to offset the loan amount, meaning you will only be charged the interest on the difference.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the risks and rewards?</h3>\n<p>If you need a loan for a short period, a fixed rate interest only loan is an attractive and affordable option. It is particularly useful for investors who would use interest only payments for tax purposes and then sell the property before needing to pay off the principal. For owner-occupier borrowers, do remember that you won&rsquo;t be repaying any of the original amount you borrowed during this time and at the end of the period your repayments will increase to include part of the borrowed funds plus interest.</p>",,1300,0,11,8,67,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,139.55,201.0

The ability to redraw funds that you have overpaid can be very useful if you have an unexpected expense or would like more cash for an upcoming holiday.</p>\n<h3>How do fixed rate home loans with redraw facility work?</h3>\n<p>With a fixed rate home loan, you sign up to make repayments on a regular basis at the same amount, that is, the interest rate is fixed for an agreed period so will not change if interest rates should go up or down. This is a useful type of home loan if you want the security of knowing and budgeting for the precise amount of your outgoings every month. Fixed rate home loans with redraw facility offer the additional feature of allowing you to pay more than the agreed amount from time to time, and then letting you reclaim some of those funds when you need extra money.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features of a fixed rate loan with a redraw facility?</h3>\n<p>Fixed rate home loans often have fewer features than their variable rate counterparts, however, a loan that has a redraw facility is a valuable addition on a number of counts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you wish, you can pay extra amounts thereby actively reducing the interest charged to the loan.</li>\n<li>You will still be able to pay the agreed rate for a fixed period of time, without obligation to make extra payments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Among the types of home loans that may offer redraw facilities are standard or no frills loans, best suited to those who have regular sources of income and who prefer conventional facilities. Some interest only home loans also offer redraw facilities.</p>\n<p>Bundled home loans usually offer a suite of features to help keep the borrowing as affordable as possible. Self employed people, homeowners and investors can all make use of bundled loans. Speciality loans include bad credit home loans and low doc varieties which may offer redraw facilities depending on the features available.</p>\n<h3>What are the risks and rewards?</h3>\n<p>During the fixed period you will have the security of fixed payments even if interest rates should rise. The consistency of a fixed rate loan means planning your budget is easier so you are more in control of your money. Having a redraw facility attached to the loan also means that you can access the extra repayments you have made into the loan to use for other projects and investments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your lender may set limits on the amount you can overpay, however, and how often you can redraw. If you want to refinance your loan during the fixed term you may incur extra charges that are often higher than exit fees for variable rate loans. If you make extra repayments over the limit set by your lender you could be liable for some penalty fees. It&rsquo;s also the case that some lenders charge for redraws so check all these points carefully before applying for a fixed rate home loan with redraw facility.</p>",,170,6,52,24,480,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,79.4,238.0

If you put aside some time for research you are much more likely to come to the correct decision as to what product is best suited to your needs.</p>\n<h3>What are flexible home loans?</h3>\n<p>Unlike fixed rate loans, where the rate of interest doesn&rsquo;t change, flexible home loans have variable rates that fluctuate according to the cash rate and market. These loans also provide a range of features that allow them to be customised to suit your personal circumstances, thereby making them flexible.</p>\n<h3>How do flexible home loans compare to other similar products?</h3>\n<p>When you compare home loans you need to carefully consider the features that come with them. In general terms, the more features included with your home loan the more flexible it is likely to be. Check also that the interest rates and the repayment style will suit your circumstances.

On the plus side, you can benefit from the flexibility of both making and redrawing additional payments.

There are a number of additional restrictions in this area that can make it harder for you to find the right one, but if you&rsquo;re patient and you approach your search in the right way, you should be able to source something that works for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>Deposits on apartments</strong></h3>\n<p>Apartment loans are complicated because lenders consider them higher risk than houses, particularly if they are newer dwellings. This is mostly because it&rsquo;s more difficult to sell an apartment than a house, so if you default on your loan they may struggle to recover their money. For this reason, they usually ask for at least a 20 per cent deposit. Because apartments tend to be cheaper, however, this won&rsquo;t necessarily stop you from being able to get the deal you want. If you&rsquo;re really struggling, finding a guarantor may help your situation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Size and bedroom requirements</strong></h3>\n<p>In order to reduce the risk of them being unable to sell if you default, many&nbsp;lenders refuse to offer loans for apartments under 45m&sup2; (not including the balcony). They sometimes also insist that the property has a separate bedroom and living area, because studio apartments are particularly difficult for them to shift. This means that in some cases you may find it&rsquo;s easier to buy a property that&rsquo;s slightly larger than you need.</p>\n<h3><strong>Risks for the lender</strong></h3>\n<p>As well as worrying about resale, lenders providing home loans for apartments don&rsquo;t like putting too much of their money into one building, because if something goes wrong with the building it could place them at serious financial risk. This means that if they have already invested in other apartments in the same complex, they may be less willing to invest in yours. In this situation you will usually be able to find a different lender willing to help you.</p>\n<h3><strong>What do you need?</strong></h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to obtain a loan like this if you begin the process with a clear idea of what you need. Start by thinking about the size of property you want and how many rooms it should have, and then think about what you need from a loan. Are low interest rates the most important thing, are you anxious to pay it off as fast as you can, or are there special features that could make all the difference to whether or not you will accept a deal?</p>\n<h3><strong>Comparing home loans</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve identified a group of loans that could meet your requirements, you&rsquo;ll need to compare them to establish which offers the best financial deal.

However, getting a home loan can sometimes prove difficult for business owners because the paperwork that many lenders require is often not available when it comes to supplying proof of income. If this is a problem for you, it may be the right time to seek out a home loan that is specially geared towards business owners.</p>\n<h3>Why opt for home loans for business owners?</h3>\n<p>If you are self-employed, working freelance or are a relatively new entrepreneur in Australia, you might find that <span>home loans for business owners</span> are of great benefit. For example, a &lsquo;low doc&rsquo; home loan allows you to minimise the amount of documentation that&rsquo;s normally expected in order to get a loan &ndash; think pay slips, income evidence and tax returns. Of course, if you have sufficient up to date financial documentation you may be able to access a standard home loan instead. Some business owners opt for home loans purely for investment purposes, while others use them as business loans or to help them to continue to occupy their own premises.</p>\n<h3>What are the main choices for home loans for business owners?</h3>\n<p>The choices you will have reflect the home loans marketplace and when you are considering a low doc loan check out both the fixed rate and variable rate options, depending on your circumstances. If you have a secured property, you can also borrow against its value.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed rate options mean you are locked into a specific rate for a given period, making it easier to manage your budget.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Variable rate options mean your repayments can go down as well as up and this provides you with a degree of flexibility, but also less certainty than the fixed rate alternative.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Borrowing against the value of your home is a third option, best utilised if you are confident that the property market is buoyant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the rewards and risks?</h3>\n<p>On the plus side for home loans for business owners you have less paperwork to deal with in terms of providing documentary evidence of your income status; your personally signed statements are generally accepted. You also have a range of choices when it comes to the type of loan you want.</p>\n<p>On the negative side, you will most likely discover you are paying higher interest rates and that higher fees may apply then are normally charged on home loans. You may also see that the lender will apply a lower LVR (loan to value ratio), which simply means that you can borrow against your property&rsquo;s value but to a lower ceiling than applies to other types of home loans. Beyond this, if for instance you want to borrow more than 60 per cent of the value of your property, you may be required to take out additional insurance. Lender&rsquo;s Mortgage Insurance (LMI) is the most common and there may additionally be other fees. Always investigate every aspect of a loan agreement before committing to it.</p>",,5,3,16,11,397,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,45.75,271.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong>Home loans for doctors</strong></h1>\n<p>Being a doctor presents many challenges, one of which is the fact that due to the requirements of the job you may not have as much choice as other people over where you live. There is a positive side to this however. Even if you&rsquo;re based in an area where property prices are high, you could save money by securing an especially advantageous home loan. With a lower rate of interest and with access to special features, you could find that paying off the mortgage on your home is a lot easier than you expected.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do doctors get special deals?</strong></h3>\n<p>The reason why doctors are offered special deals on home loans is simple: they work in a vital profession and are likely to be high earners during their career. Because of this, lenders consider doctors to be low risk borrowers. Similar arrangements apply for some other professionals, such as lawyers. Some lenders are so confident about doctors that they will lend 100% of the value of the property &ndash; with no deposit needed at all &ndash; but insurance is always required in that case.</p>\n<h3><strong>Who is eligible for these deals?</strong></h3>\n<p>Although lenders assume that doctors will have high earnings, you don&rsquo;t always need to be in one of the higher earning specialties in order to qualify for these loans. They&rsquo;re usually available to people right across the profession, from oncologists to gynaecologists, and even to those at the start of their careers. Of course, you will still have to meet the lender&rsquo;s other requirements, such as having enough money for a deposit and having a reasonably good credit record.</p>\n<h3><strong>Features to look out for</strong></h3>\n<p>When you apply for a loan as a doctor, there are several things you should look out for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower interest rates;</li>\n<li>No LMI (Lender&rsquo;s Mortgage Insurance);</li>\n<li>Discounts on fees;</li>\n<li>The chance to borrow more in proportion to your deposit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For anybody getting a home loan, it&rsquo;s worth talking to the lender directly to try and get a better del. This is especially the case if you&rsquo;re a doctor as you can be confident that the lender will want your custom.</p>\n<h3><strong>Main considerations</strong></h3>\n<p>Although home loans for doctors are usually available right across the profession, some individual lenders do limit them to particular specialties, so the first thing you will need to do is find out if you are eligible. Once you have narrowed down a group of possible lenders, use the comparison rate to work out which are offering the best basic deals &ndash; this rate takes into account both the interest rate and most fees, which can sometimes be hard to spot otherwise.&nbsp; You should then look at the additional features offered, such as the option of making early repayments at no charge, and decide what&rsquo;s most important to you.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Where can you get a special deal?</strong></h3>\n<p>The following lenders offer special deals on home loans to doctors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ANZ</li>\n<li>BOQ Specialist</li>\n<li>Commonwealth Bank</li>\n<li>Westpac.</li>\n</ul>",,5,25,221,198,5919,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,667.75,124.0

You could get a grant to help with your purchase, lower rates on loans, or support to help you manage your finances and keep up with your monthly payments after you buy.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Indigenous Home Ownership Program</strong></h3>\n<p>The Indigenous Home Ownership Program from Indigenous Business Australia is a scheme designed to help you buy an existing property or build a new one. You won&rsquo;t need a big deposit to get a loan this way and you can benefit from a low interest rate. Lengthy loan terms are available to keep your monthly payments low and in some case the loan term can be extended further to make it easier for you to manage. You could be eligible for extra help if you want to build on communal land.</p>\n<h3><strong>Are you eligible for an IBA loan?</strong></h3>\n<p>IBA loans are available to people with Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander backgrounds. You&rsquo;ll have to be over 18 and have enough income to be able to meet the minimum payment threshold, as well as some savings you can put into a deposit &ndash; you may be able to get help with the latter.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to apply for an IBA loan</strong></h3>\n<p>You can download the forms you need to register an interest in an IBA home loan from the IBA website. After you have returned them you will have to wait in a queue until the IBA has enough funding free to assist you, at which point you will be invited to make a formal application. In some cases the IBA will be able to loan you all the money you need directly; in others it will lend you part of it and you can arrange to borrow the rest from another lender.</p>\n<h3><strong>KeyStart Aboriginal Home Loans</strong></h3>\n<p>Western Australians can take advantage of the KeyStart Aboriginal Home Loan scheme. This offers you two options: you can buy your home in the usual way or you can opt to share ownership with the Department of Housing. Deposits can be as low as 2% and you will have the facility to make as many early repayments as you are able to at no extra charge.</p>\n<h3><strong>The right loan for you</strong></h3>\n<p>Whether or not you choose to make use of the home loans for Indigenous Australians program, you will need to weigh up your priorities before deciding what is right for you. Do you want low interest rates to keep your payments manageable, low fees so extra costs, or extra features such as the ability to pay back your loan early without penalty? Do you want a short loan term or a long one? The clearer you are about this when you start looking, the better your chance of getting your ideal home loan.</p>",,390,44,612,521,18102,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2041.15,66.0

This is true to an extent, but there are a lot of home loans for pensioners out there, and some of them offer very good deals. Whether you want to buy a new home or draw on the equity in your existing home so that you can have some money with which to enjoy life, you should be able to locate a suitable product.</p>\n<h3><strong>Getting a home loan as a pensioner</strong></h3>\n<p>The biggest challenge to getting a home loan as a pensioner is that your income will probably be lower than average. Because lenders see this as a risk &ndash; something that&rsquo;s likely to make it more difficult for you to keep up with your payments &ndash; they are likely to charge a higher rate of interest, and some will be unwilling to lend you money at all. There are, however, specific loan products out there designed for pensioners. These often draw on the fact that you are likely to have a lot of equity in your home, and use that to balance the risk.</p>\n<h3><strong>Home loans for disability pensioners</strong></h3>\n<p>If getting a home loan is difficult after you&rsquo;re retired, you might expect it to be even more difficult if you have retired on disability. In reality that&rsquo;s not the case. Many lenders see disability payments as a reliable source of income and will actually be prepared to lend you more money in this situation. You may need to provide additional paperwork, including documents from Centrelink confirming the benefits you receive, and more bank statements than the average borrower. Cases involving disability are usually assessed manually instead of being submitted for approval by a computer system, so you can get a solution tailored to your circumstances.</p>\n<h3><strong>Reverse mortgages</strong></h3>\n<p>A reverse mortgage is a special arrangement available to pensioners who own their homes. It enables you to draw on the equity in your home so that you have money to spend when you need it. You can continue to live in your home but when you choose to sell it or move into residential care, or when you die, the lender will recover the money. There are various arrangements available &ndash; for instance, you could get a lump sum to spend on your dream holiday, or you could get a steady income to improve your day-to-day standard of living.</p>\n<h3><strong>Line of credit loans</strong></h3>\n<p>A line of credit loan also draws on the equity you have in your home but rather than giving you a predetermined amount, it simply places a limit on how much you can borrow. This means that if you discover you don&rsquo;t need all of it, you won&rsquo;t be paying interest on money you haven&rsquo;t used. Beware though, it is like having a large credit card, so before you take a line of credit it's important to ensure you have the capacity to repay it as a pensioner.</p>",,390,185,735,687,11199,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1464.7,79.0

You will still have to go through an application process as you would for any other loan, with no guarantee of success, but if you are a responsible person who can manage money well, a government loan could be the solution to your problems.</p>\n<p>What type of government home loan you are eligible for will depend on where you live. Here are some examples of government-partnered schemes. Before you apply for any, make sure you do your own due diligence.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Keystart</strong></h3>\n<p>Keystart is a Western Australian scheme designed to help people who are struggling to save a deposit. Some users need a 2 per cent&nbsp;deposit if they are&nbsp;buying in a metro area or a 10 per cent deposit if they're&nbsp;buying in a regional area. To be eligible, you'll have to meet a set of criteria including being&nbsp;at least 18 years old and intending to use the property as your main home.</p>\n<h3><strong>Shared equity</strong></h3>\n<p>Also available through Keystart are shared equity home loans. These work on a shared ownership principal. Loans are made available so that residents can buy a stake in their homes, with the Housing Authority remaining in partial ownership. This arrangement provides some of the security of home ownership and could put you in a better position to buy a home independently in the future.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>HomeStart Finance</strong></h3>\n<p>HomeStart Finance is a South Australian scheme that allows some applicants to purchase properties with as little as a 3 per cent deposit. There&rsquo;s no insurance to pay and initial repayments are worked out based not on the interest rate but on what you can afford. You&rsquo;ll need to be over 18 and either have a good history as a renter or have had savings of $3,000 for at least three months (to prove that you&rsquo;re reliable). These loans are open to citizens, permanent residents and skilled migrants but can only be used to buy a property you&rsquo;re going to live in.</p>\n<h3><strong>Queensland Housing Finance Loan</strong></h3>\n<p>Queenslanders are also eligible for a scheme that requires no loan insurance. It&rsquo;s available with a deposit as low as 2 per cent and there are no monthly fees attached. Payments are based on your income, starting at 30 per cent of what you have coming in and never rising above 35 per cent. You&rsquo;ll need to have a good credit record and a good savings history, have the capacity to keep earning for the full term of the loan, and have enough money in your savings to be able to pay for home insurance, stamp duty and legal fees. The loan is only available if you&rsquo;re a citizen or permanent resident, own no other property and intend to live in the property you&rsquo;re buying.</p>",,110,0,8,9,496,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,63.15,250.0

A guarantor will take over the responsibility of your home loan if you cannot meet the repayments.</p>\n<p>In most cases, it is usually parents or a close immediate family member who will be accepted as a guarantor.</p>\n<p>Having a guarantor home loan also helps you to sidestep lender&rsquo;s mortgage insurance (LMI), which can mean savings of thousands of dollars.</p>\n<h3>How could a guarantor help you?</h3>\n<p>Having a guarantor in place means you may be able to get a home loan even if you have previously been turned down for several. It also means you may not need a deposit at all, and you certainly won&rsquo;t need as much for a deposit. You may also be able to arrange a lower rate of interest than you would have to pay otherwise. A guarantor can help even if you have been told your credit record isn&rsquo;t good enough for you to be eligible for a loan, as long as the guarantor&rsquo;s credit is good.</p>\n<h3>How much can I borrow with a guarantor home loan?</h3>\n<p>The amount you can borrow using a guarantor will depend on your borrowing status.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, you might be able to borrow up to 105 per cent of the property&rsquo;s value. However, the most common scenario is that you will be expected to provide a 20 per cent deposit and borrow the other 80 per cent.</p>\n<h3>How does a guarantor home loan work?</h3>\n<p>If you want to get into the property market sooner rather than later, guarantors can make your first home dream come true. Generally, parents help their children by providing a guarantee for your home loan which is tied to security on the guarantor&rsquo;s property.</p>\n<p>When you have repaid a chunk of your home loan or your property value has increased, then you can seek to remove the guarantor.</p>\n<p>Once your loan-to-value ratio (LVR), which is the percentage of the remaining loan figure against your property value, has been reduced to 80 per cent you can action to remove the guarantee and also avoid lender&rsquo;s mortgage insurance (LMI). Some lenders allow you to release a loan guarantor if your LVR sits at 90 per cent but the downside is that a LMI premium will apply.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of guarantor loans</h3>\n<p>The benefits of a guarantor home loans are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can enter the market sooner</li>\n<li>You can save thousands of dollars by avoiding LMI</li>\n<li>You can potentially buy a more expensive home</li>\n<li>Some lenders will offer discounted interest rates for guarantor loans</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who can be your guarantor?</h3>\n<p>Most banks only allow parents to be guarantors for home loans.</p>\n<p>Some will consider guarantees from immediate family members like siblings, grandparents, spouses, de facto partners or adult children. Close friends and workmates are usually not accepted.</p>\n<p>If your guarantor is someone other than your parents, you may have to meet other lending conditions to qualify as a borrower.</p>\n<h3>Risks of guarantor loans</h3>\n<p>Should you miss a mortgage payment or due to changing financial circumstances you cannot keep up your end of the bargain, your guarantor comes into play and will be liable to pick up the slack.</p>\n<p>Some people fear that the lender might move quickly to sell the guarantor&rsquo;s home in order to recoup missed mortgage repayments, but this kind of drastic action is usually a last resort. This is a significant and costly process, and banks struggle to break even when they take this path. That said, the possibility can&rsquo;t be ignored. If you can&rsquo;t keep up with your mortgage repayments, there is always a risk that the bank will seize your home &ndash; and, if necessary, move against your guarantor as well.</p>\n<p>Guarantor home loans can be very personal and can carry risk. Financial humps can lead to breakdown in close relationships and this can cause deep emotional pain.</p>\n<p>It is advisable that a guarantor never signs a contract without advice from a lawyer.</p>\n<p>A guarantor needs to be aware of the terms and conditions and the extent of your liability if the borrower defaults.</p>\n<h3>What are guarantor loans called?</h3>\n<p>Different lenders use different names for their guarantor loans. Some examples include &lsquo;Family Pledge&rsquo;, &lsquo;Family Equity&rsquo;, &lsquo;Family Support&rsquo;, &lsquo;Family Guarantee&rsquo; and &lsquo;Fast Track&rsquo;. This is something to be aware of during your research.</p>\n<p>But whatever the name, they all translate into the same thing. These terms basically refer to security guarantee.</p>\n<p>Beware, though, that there are differences between every lender&rsquo;s credit guidelines, loan types and discounts for family guarantee loans. Doing your own homework can lead to savings.</p>\n<h3>Should I be a guarantor?</h3>\n<p>Becoming a guarantor is a major decision so it pays that you seek independent financial advice before you jump in. These questions must be answered:</p>\n<p>* How big is the guarantee that you are committing yourself to? Can you cover the ongoing mortgage payments if the borrower folds?</p>\n<p>* When will you be liable to cough up money? Usually, banks and other lenders will proceed if the mortgage is in arrears for three to six months.</p>\n<p>* How credible is the person that you are acting as guarantor for? One has to be brutally honest in answering this, especially if it involves your own son or daughter.</p>\n<h3>Parent-assisted home loan option</h3>\n<p>Another option out there if you&rsquo;re struggling to save up for a deposit is the parent-assisted home loan. This helps in cutting down the risks involved in being a guarantor.</p>\n<p>A parent-assisted mortgage resembles receiving a gifted deposit. The distinction here is you will have to pay back this gift to your parents with interest.</p>\n<p>If the guarantors are extra keen to help out their children and do not have the required equity in their property, they can apply for a personal loan or a second mortgage on their property.</p>\n<h3>Do I need expert advice if I&rsquo;m a guarantor?</h3>\n<p>Being a home loan guarantor is a big commitment and you should seek expert advice from appropriate professionals.</p>\n<p>It is desirable that before applying you have a preliminary discussion with your lawyer and then put the &ldquo;guarantee and indemnity&rsquo; documents for legal scrutiny before signing on the dotted line.</p>\n<p>One must also have an exit strategy in mind. For example, if the loan is for 25 years, you don't have to be involved for that period. Extra payments and refinancing can help remove the guarantee in two to five years.</p>\n<p>The guarantor&rsquo;s risk can also be minimised by their children if they procure insurance for their own mortgage so the guarantor&rsquo;s property is protected.</p>",,1900,12,85,89,3864,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,608.5,128.0

Realistically, it's likely that you'll have to borrow quite a lot, so before you sit down with your mortgage advisor or broker, establish what your options are and the terminology that surrounds them. <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/mortgage-calculator"">High LVR loans</a></span> are one way forward, but be sure that you know what this means.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are high LVR home loans?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>When a mortgage company looks at how much you want to borrow for your new home, it will look at that against what the value of the property is deemed to be and how much of a deposit you have available to put down. This is called Loan to Value Ratio &ndash; hence LVR &ndash; and it's the proportion of money you need from a lender in relation to the purchase value of the property.</p>\n<p>Let's say that you want to buy a house valued at $450,000 and you've got $90,000 to put down as a deposit. That means you're looking for $360,000, making your LVR 80%, the relationship between &pound;$60,000 and $450,000. An 80% LVR rate is usually the minimum that the majority of <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">loan providers</a></span> will want. If it's greater than that, you may need to take out an insurance policy to protect the lender from default.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do these loans compare to other products?</strong></h2>\n<p>High LVR loans can be a good way to get onto the first rung of the property ladder but how much you will pay in terms of costs for setting up and the amount of interest charged will depend on how high the LVR is. It will also depend on your credit history and the lender's certainty, as far as is possible, that you will be able to repay the debt. You should always search for the best possible option because many lenders would like your signature and may, from time to time, offer attractive LVR deals.</p>\n<h2><strong>Are there particular risks involved with these loans?</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;The valuation of the property that you want to buy is important as valuations can fluctuate, potentially leaving you with more money to spend in the long term. Always employ an independent professional, and try to get an ""arm&rsquo;s length"" valuation so that neither the lender nor the buyer is involved. If the lender considers you higher risk but is still prepared to lend you the money having assessed the LVR, expect to pay a higher interest rate. If things go well, you're on the road to having your own property as a tangible asset well into the future.</p>",,20,16,126,95,782,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,121.35,208.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong>Home loans in Hobart</strong></h1>\n<p>The centre of Australia&rsquo;s most southern state, the city of Hobart is both the governmental and financial hub of Tasmania. It has an extensive historical influence and is therefore attractive to international and interstate tourists.</p>\n<p>Hobart&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">home loan</a> sector and property market can fluctuate with external factors but minimal housing and development causes a demand for properties in the city. If you are looking to buy or invest in Hobart it is important to research the city and weigh up the positives and negatives carefully.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Hobart like?</strong></h2>\n<p>Hobart is located on the Derwent River with properties situated on both sides of the waterway. Due to its location the city is economically reliant on marine activities, mainly, from cargo and cruise ships as well as research teams going to and from the Antarctic. The city has a mild climate with strong winds and low temperatures a feature during six months of the year.</p>\n<p>Hobart features streets of historic homes and buildings that serve to attract tourists and further bolster the city&rsquo;s economy. In addition to housing the state&rsquo;s governmental bodies and parliament, Hobart is also the base for several national and multinational companies, including, Incat, Nyrstar and Cadbury&rsquo;s Chocolate Factory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>What do I need to know about Hobart&rsquo;s economy and property market?</strong></h2>\n<p>Historically and over recent decades, Hobart and the rest of Tasmania was well known for having one of the worst employment rates in the country. This is slowly improving but Tasmania is still struggling below most other states. This is reflected in the property market with generally lower property prices and low sale rates. The more affordable prices have brought investors to the city looking to capitalise on a buyer&rsquo;s market. This, in turn, has created a slight property shortage with fewer properties being placed on the market than in previous years.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>How does this compare to other capital cities in Australia?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Mainly due to its low levels of employment opportunities and industry, Hobart is less in demand than other Australian cities. Both Sydney and Melbourne have a steady economy despite external factors, where Hobart is more reliant on the performance of local industries and government policy. The city can be more closely compared to Perth and Darwin, which also suffer from the effects of isolation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Why should I get a home loan in Hobart?</strong></h2>\n<p>Due to a current upturn in industry and tourism, Hobart may be&nbsp;a good choice for investors and first time homebuyers. Median property prices are lower than many other capital cities with many historic or character properties on offer. Hobart can be an affordable option if you are looking at purchasing a property in a capital city but don&rsquo;t want to contend with the expensive prices and supply problems of either Sydney or Melbourne. The city&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">home loan</a> sector is regulated mostly by the federal government with some input from the state government and is therefore similar to other states and cities in Australia.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What issues may I face?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you are looking at getting a home loan in Hobart, you will have to pay similar fees and duties as in the other cities in Australia. The local council will also impose some biannual rates. Due to increasing investor interest there may be a growing shortage of properties on the market and you may have less property options in the more popular suburbs.</p>",,20,0,5,3,1008,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,104.00000000000001,212.0

Secondly, you&rsquo;ll have to pay more over the life of the mortgage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why you should think carefully before taking out this sort of loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It sounds obvious, but you should only choose an interest-only loan over a principal-and-interest loan if you&rsquo;re convinced the short-term gains will exceed the long-term costs. The key, though, is to actually do your sums.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information on&nbsp;interest-only loans, read the FAQ below.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>What are interest-only loans?</h3>\n<p>Most mortgages are principal-and-interest loans, which require borrowers to simultaneously pay interest and pay down their principal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, with interest-only loans, borrowers only pay interest, which means their principal doesn&rsquo;t get reduced.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, imagine you wanted to buy a $440,000 property. You might borrow $350,000 at an interest rate of 5 per cent, with the mortgage spread over 30 years and repayments scheduled for each month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you had a principal-and-interest loan, you would have to pay $1,889 per month &ndash; $1,468 of that would be interest, while the other $421 would go towards reducing the principal. (So, after one month, your mortgage would be reduced from $350,000 to $349,579. After two months, it would be reduced to $349,158.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you had an interest-only loan, you would have to pay just $1,468 per month. This would be nothing but interest, so your outstanding mortgage would remain at $350,000.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Generally, interest-only loans last for five years, at which point the loan automatically reverts to a principal-and-interest loan (although some lenders will allow you to extend the interest-only period).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the example above, you would now be left with 25 years to repay your $350,000 mortgage, which would require monthly repayments of $2,056.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you did five years of interest-only followed by 25 years of principal-and-interest, your total cost would be $704,920. If you did 30 years of principal-and-interest, your total cost would be $679,995 &ndash; a difference of $24,924.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=""rc-embed-widget"" data-rc-colour=""63738c"" data-rc-url=""//blaze.ratecity.com.au/widgets/compare/home-loans/big4/imb/budget-home-loan-lvr-70-80?h_maxBorrowingAmount=250000&h_maxLoanTerm=30""></div>\n<script src=""//blaze.ratecity.com.au/blaze-assets/embedWidget.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>What are the pros of interest-only loans?</h3>\n<p>Clearly, people take out interest-only loans so they can reduce their repayments during the interest-only period. But the real point of interest-only loans is not so much to save money but to use this money to do something else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the example above, you&rsquo;d be left with an extra $421 in your pocket each month. Here are three ways you could use that extra money to your advantage:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enter the market ahead of schedule</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you were a young first home buyer, you might not be able to afford to buy your hypothetical $440,000 property if you had to pay $1,889 per month. However, you might be able to afford it if you only had to repay $1,468 per month for the first five years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sure, you&rsquo;d have to pay an extra $24,924 over the life of the mortgage. But if you held off entering the market until you had enough money to afford a principal-and-interest loan, your property might end up costing you an extra $30,000 or $40,000.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, by the time your mortgage reverts to principal-and-interest, your salary is likely to be higher, which would hopefully mean that you could now afford the increased repayments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>WARNING: This strategy could backfire if your property doesn&rsquo;t increase in value during the five-year period or if you can&rsquo;t afford the higher repayments once it ends.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=""2"">\n<li>Buy an investment property ahead of schedule</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Imagine that you used an interest-only loan to enter the market ahead of schedule &ndash; but this time with an <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/investment-property"">investment property</a>. And imagine the value of this investment increased by 10 per cent during the interest-only period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In that case, your property&rsquo;s value would climb from $440,000 to $484,000 &ndash; so you&rsquo;d pay an extra $24,924 in repayments to gain an extra $44,000 in equity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, if your investment property was negatively geared, you&rsquo;d be able to use some of the interest payments to reduce your taxable income.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>WARNING: This strategy could backfire if your property doesn&rsquo;t increase in value during the five-year period or if you can&rsquo;t afford the higher repayments once it ends.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=""3"">\n<li>Repay higher-interest debt</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Starting your mortgage with an interest-only term could be smart if you also had to repay other debts that were priced higher than the 5 per cent being charged for your mortgage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you could use the extra $421 per month to pay off a car loan (at, say, 8 per cent), a personal loan (12 per cent) or a credit card debt (15 per cent).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>WARNING: This strategy could backfire if you didn&rsquo;t use the extra money to repay the other debts or if you couldn&rsquo;t afford the higher repayments once your interest-only period ended.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>What are the cons of interest-only loans?</h3>\n<p>There are two big disadvantages with interest-only loans. First, your mortgage doesn&rsquo;t decrease during the interest-only period. Second, you end up paying more over the life of the mortgage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The other disadvantage is that the repayments you will be charged once you move from interest-only to principal-and-interest will be higher than if you&rsquo;d been on principal-and-interest all along. That could cause problems if your financial position hadn&rsquo;t improved during the interest-only period.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>What's&nbsp;an example of an interest-only mortgage?</h3>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take the example quoted above &ndash; a 30-year mortgage worth $350,000 with monthly repayments and an interest rate of 5 per cent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The table below shows what would happen if the mortgage functioned as a principal-and-interest loan for the entire 30 years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It also shows what would happen if you went interest-only for five, 10 or 15 of the 30 years, before switching to principal-and-interest for the remainder of the loan term.</p>\n<div class=""table-responsive"">\n<table class=""table table-striped"">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Scenario</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Principal-and interest loan</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Interest-only for 5&nbsp;years</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Interest-only for 10&nbsp;years</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Interest-only for 15&nbsp;years</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Monthly repayments during interest-only period</td>\n<td>$1,889</td>\n<td>$1,468</td>\n<td>$1,468</td>\n<td>$1,468</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monthly repayments after interest-only period</td>\n<td>$1,889</td>\n<td>$2,056</td>\n<td>$2,320</td>\n<td>$2,778</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total repayments made</td>\n<td>$679,995</td>\n<td>$704,920</td>\n<td>$732,963</td>\n<td>$764,300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Additional interest paid due to the interest-only period</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$24,924</td>\n<td>$52,968</td>\n<td>$84,305</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=""table-responsive""></div>",,1300,622,4305,4790,75379,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,9343.150000000001,35.0

Depending on pronouncements by the central bank, they could go up or down, or they could remain static for a period of time, depending on the economic climate. When you start to do your research on investment loan rates for a second or further property, you may be offered a range of products. As well as the standard fixed, variable or split rates, as with standard mortgages, you could look into interest only investment loan rates to see if you think such a loan would be suitable for your needs.</p>\n<h2>What is an interest only investment loan?</h2>\n<p>Usually, when people take out a mortgage, they pay interest on the sum borrowed together with an agreed amount that reduces the principal sum over the period of time of the loan. The idea is that at the end of the mortgage term, you have paid off everything that you owe and own the property. With an interest only investment loan, your repayments just pay the interest part of the loan, they do not reduce the principal sum. It gives you the opportunity to manage your cash flow by making smaller monthly repayments than for a standard home loan, and when you can afford some extra repayments you can put them towards the principal. Depending on your lender, you may be able to get a flexible repayment schedule so that you can have greater control over cash flow.</p>\n<h2>What are the risks with this type of loan?</h2>\n<p>As with any loan there are risks, the main one being a change of personal circumstances where your income is suddenly diminished. It's one reason why an interest only investment loan could be attractive, with those lower monthly repayments and more flexibility. Another risk is that interest rates rise and are then passed on by your lender, meaning that you'll have to have additional resources to make your repayments. The flip side to this is that if interest rates go down, your lender should (they don't always) pass the cut to you, potentially enabling you to put some money towards paying off the principal as well.</p>\n<h2>How do interest only investment loan rates compare with other products?</h2>\n<p>This is where you need to do your research to source the best interest rate and conditions that you can. It's important to remember that although you may be able to get a fixed rate for a period of time, you are still not paying off the principal sum. This means that at the end of the loan period, you will still have to provide the money to pay this off. Some people will sell at the end of the period, hoping the property has increased in price so that they make a profit, while others may use a savings vehicle looking for good returns over a period of many years to use as repayment of the principal. Whatever you decide, do some thorough research to determine what's best for you.</p>",,1300,171,1699,1722,14937,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2222.35,61.0

While it&rsquo;s natural to focus on the size of your monthly payments or how long it will take you to pay off the loan in its entirety, paying close attention to interest rates themselves is vital. Individual borrower needs vary, but making the wrong choice could mean that you end up paying a lot more than you need.</p>\n<h3><strong>Comparing interest rates</strong></h3>\n<p>Comparing home loan interest rates can be difficult because they&rsquo;re presented in different ways. When you&rsquo;re looking for a loan, always check the comparison rate. This figure is designed to make it easy for you to see which loans offer the best value in simple monetary terms.</p>\n<p>There are different types of interest rates you can choose from, and which will be best for you will depend on your circumstances.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fixed interest rates</strong></h3>\n<p>A fixed interest rate will not change at any point, so you will always know exactly what your repayments will be. This can make it easier to budget. The rates offered on loans like this are usually a bit higher than on variable rate loans, but if the RBA cash&nbsp;rate rises, you will save money compared to what you would have had to pay otherwise. The main downside of fixed rate loans is that they don&rsquo;t offer much flexibility and if you want to leave them early you may&nbsp;have to pay a break fee.</p>\n<h3><strong>Variable interest rates</strong></h3>\n<p>Taking out a loan with a variable interest rate means that what you pay will change over time. These loans usually offer the lowest rates available, but it&rsquo;s important to note that what you pay can go up as well as down, depending on the national interest rate. Loans like this often offer extra features such as the ability to make extra repayments at no charge or to set up an interest offset account.</p>\n<h3><strong>Split interest rates</strong></h3>\n<p>Loans offering split interest rates basically let you fix part of the loan and pay the rest at the variable rate. This reduces the amount of risk involved but gives you some of the advantages offered by the variable rate, such as lower initial costs and the prospect of saving money if the RBA cash rate&nbsp;falls.</p>\n<h3><strong>Things to consider</strong></h3>\n<p>Before deciding which type of interest rate is right for you, you should ask yourself the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How careful do you need to be? If you are on a low income, security will be more important.</li>\n<li>How flexible do you want to be? Would it significantly benefit you to be able to pay the loan off early?</li>\n<li>How much money can you save up each month with the rate you are considering?</li>\n<li>How might your income change over the duration of the loan?&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are still unsure what type of loan suits you best, discuss these matters with a financial adviser. Making a good decision at this stage can help you avoid financial difficulties and mean you&rsquo;re not paying more than you need to overall.</p>",,5400,0,0,0,30,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,543.0,132.0

You could get a very competitive rate to start with, enabling you to plan your finances for the future.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is an </strong><strong>introductory variable rate home loan</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Often known as honeymoon loans, an introductory variable rate home loan is popular with first time buyers because they are likely to have saved hard for their deposit and the other costs associated with buying a home. They could do with a little space to rebuild their finances as they embark on their first mortgage and this type of loan could help. If you're in that position then it's worth investigating the options, but it can also be available if you are a second homebuyer or looking to refinance or invest. You'll be offered a lower rate than the lender's standard for a fixed period, and this can be attractive when you are seeking to save money on your monthly outgoings.</p>\n<h3><strong>How does an </strong><strong>introductory variable rate home loan </strong><strong>compare to other products?</strong></h3>\n<p>This type of <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/fixed-rate"">home loan</a></span> can compare well with other products on the market but you should always look around and make comparisons. Examine the amount of time such a loan will be active for before it reverts to the standard variable interest rate the lender charges. You may be considering a fixed rate loan but are not sure if that is suitable in the early stages of a mortgage. You should therefore expect your interest rate to be lower with an introductory variable rate home loan and you could make useful savings as you start or continue on the home owning ladder.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of an </strong><strong>introductory variable rate home loan</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>Your interest rate may&nbsp;be lower than the normal rate to give you more control over the amount of your initial outgoings when buying a home. It allows you to budget precisely over the agreed term, a benefit that lenders use to attract borrowers in the first place. If you get a good initial variable rate deal the chances are you are more likely to stay with that lender because you will have saved a fair amount in interest charges on your repayments.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong></h3>\n<p>You must factor in what happens when your introductory variable rate ends. It's essential to plan ahead for when your payments will increase, so that means checking on interest rates and keeping in touch with your lender so you don't get any unpleasant surprises. You may discover you are locked in to the lender after that introductory period so look carefully at the agreement you make so you know what your options are when that cheaper rate finishes.</p>",,5,0,0,0,25,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,3.0,453.0

It's not always easy to secure a loan for that type of investment, even when interest rates are very low. It will depend on where you are considering buying, as prices will be higher in desirable areas. They can also be higher if there is a lack of inventory available, so this needs to be factored into your decisions.</p>\n<h2>What is an investment loan?</h2>\n<p>It's not much different to a regular home loan, or mortgage &ndash; it's just that you will own the property bought with such a loan but won't occupy it yourself. Many people consider it a good investment because the property is likely to appreciate in value, provided it is looked after well, and there should be a steady rental income stream. As with normal mortgages, investments loans can be agreed at a variable interest rate, a fixed rate locking you into a specific rate for a period of time, or a split rate where you can choose a mix of variable and fixed.</p>\n<h2>How does an investment loan compare to other similar products?</h2>\n<p>Investment loan rates generally work the same way as a mortgage for the property of which you are the owner-occupier, and though it may not be as cheap as a standard mortgage, it is likely to be cheaper than taking out a large bank loan or other type of loan. That doesn't mean you shouldn't shop around, because financial companies are always looking for new customers and you could secure an attractive deal. Two types of loan that investors consider attractive are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interest only - where the borrowed sum remains the same but you only make interest payments on that sum until you sell the property or at the expiry of the interest only period.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Line of credit - where, if you own a property, you can tap into any equity that you've built up on it to use as a deposit for the investment property that you want to buy. You could think of it as a sort of credit card that has a big limit, but the loan's security is given by the equity in your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tips to make it easier to get an investment loan</h2>\n<p>Loan companies want as much security as they can get: understandable because they want their money back. Very few things in the financial world are easy, but you can do a lot to help yourself.</p>\n<p>Try to put down a sizable down payment &ndash; the more you're able to afford as a deposit, the more likely you could be offered a lower interest rate for repayments, saving you money in the long term.</p>\n<p>Before approaching a lender, check out your credit score &ndash; the better your credit rating is, the more likely you are to pay less interest.</p>\n<p>Research a variety of lenders and compare their various products &ndash; you might discover some very attractive deals as companies vie for your business.</p>\n<div id=""rc-compare-widget"" data-rc-colour=""00a348"" data-rc-url=""/big4/heritage-bank/home-advantage-investment-variable-250-699k?h_max_borrowing_amount=250000&h_max_loan_term=30""></div>\n<script src=""//blaze.ratecity.com.au/blaze-assets/compareWidget.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>\n<div style=""text-align: right; max-width: 720px;""><a style=""font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-decoration: none;"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"" rel=""nofollow"">Powered by<br /> <img style=""max-width: 150px;"" alt=""RateCity.com.au"" src=""http://widgets.ratecity.com.au/images/logo/rc-logo.svg"" /></a></div>",,590,229,1464,1725,23093,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2961.15,53.0

Like sharemarket investing, property investors enter the market with the hope their investment will grow in value and deliver yield. Property tends to be considered a long-term investment, partly due to higher entry and exit costs.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is the difference between an investment loan and an owner-occupier loan?</strong></h3>\n<p>When you're an owner/occupier, your lender knows you will be living in the property that you're purchasing. There are a number of points a lender will take into account before offering you a loan to purchase a property. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The value of the property you want to buy</li>\n<li>How much you want to borrow</li>\n<li>Your credit history, especially in terms of regular repayments</li>\n<li>Your income</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The same questions will be asked when you apply for an investment loan, but a potential lender will require additional information as detailed below.</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>Based on my income and expenses...</h6>\n<h3>How much can I borrow?</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""#"">Estimate Loan Size</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>Investment loan questions</strong></h3>\n<div class=""rc-embed-widget"" data-rc-colour=""00a348"" data-rc-url=""//blaze.ratecity.com.au/widgets/compare/heritage-bank/investment-discount-variable-150k/loans-com-au/essentials-variable-investor/australian-unity-home-loans/wealth-builder-package/state-custodians/breathe-easy-investment-loan-lvr-80/greater-bank/great-rate-variable-investment-loan-new-customers?h_max_borrowing_amount=250000&h_max_loan_term=30""></div>\n<script src=""//blaze.ratecity.com.au/blaze-assets/embedWidget.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>\n<p>For an investment loan (buy to rent), a lender is likely to ask you to prove that you have enough money set aside or sufficient regular income to&nbsp;manage the <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">mortgage repayments</a> if a property is unoccupied for some reason. As you will be relying on rental income to pay off the loan, you need to bear in mind that there may be fallow months when&nbsp;you are changing over tenants, and there might be hefty expenses involved in preparing the property for reoccupation. These all eat into rental income, so your lender will want to be sure that your calculations are as accurate as possible.</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>How much can you afford per month?</h6>\n<h3>Home Loan Calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""#"">Calculate Repayments</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The lender will also be aware of the potential for a rise in the value of your property asset over a period, but will also consider information about vacancy rates in your area and any trends in property prices.</p>\n<h3><strong>Two-tier market: Why lenders charge investors higher interest rates</strong></h3>\n<p>In 2015, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) raised concerns about the growth of the investment housing market. It asked Australia&rsquo;s biggest lenders to increase their capital reserves against their loan books. Many lenders responded by changing the eligibility criteria for investor borrowers and by increasing investment property loan rates.</p>\n<p>With an investment loan, as opposed to an owner/occupier loan, the lender is effectively buying into a higher risk, as you will be engaging in a different business transaction.</p>\n<h3><strong>Other types of investment loans</strong></h3>\n<p>As well as the standard mortgage loans you can take out with financial institutions, you could also examine other options.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A line of credit is a borrowing limit that a lender can give you where, when you have repaid the money, more funds can be borrowed according to your need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have a self-managed super fund (SMSF), you may also be able to buy an investment property in your fund, but will likely pay higher inbestment loan&nbsp;rates.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fixed vs variable rates: what is the difference?</strong></h3>\n<p>When you're looking for the best investment home loan rates, you&nbsp;have a choice between fixed or variable interest rates. Which pathway you&nbsp;choose depends on a variety of factors, including your personal risk tolerance and whether the official cash rate is rising or falling.</p>\n<p>A fixed investment interest rate allows an&nbsp;investor to lock in a set repayment amount for a set period of time &ndash; usually between 1 and 5 years.</p>\n<p>A variable investment interest rate, meanwhile, can be changed by the lender periodically, and is often influenced by what the RBA does when it meets on the first Tuesday of the month.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the potential rewards of property investment?</strong></h3>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>WAnt to know more about home loans?</h6>\n<h3>Home Loans Guide</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""#"">Learn More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4><strong>Return on investment</strong></h4>\n<p>The ultimate goal of investing in property is achieving a return above the original investment. There are two ways to achieve this: The first is to sell the property for a higher price than you bought it for, and the second is to earn income from your property by renting it out to tenants. Because the property market is imperfect, there is a chance you could sell your property for above its true value.</p>\n<h4><strong>Less volatility</strong></h4>\n<p>While no investment is ever 100 per cent safe, the property market is generally less volatile than other markets, like the sharemarket, which can rapidly lose value due to circumstances outside of the investor&rsquo;s control. Property transactions are slower than sharemarket transactions.</p>\n<h4><strong>Tax benefit</strong>&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Property investors may be eligible for a number of tax benefits, including capital gains discounts, capital gains offsets, deductions for repairs and maintenance if and when the property is tenanted, and negative gearing.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>Intergenerational wealth transfer</strong></h4>\n<p>Bricks and mortar property investments are sometimes made to allow families to bestow wealth to their beneficiaries.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the risks of property investment?</strong></h3>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>All the latest market updates</h6>\n<h3>Home Loan News</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""#"">Read Now</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4><strong>Negative return </strong></h4>\n<p>Not all property markets rise and there is a risk that your investment may not yield the results you expect. This risk may be more pronounced in suburbs exposed to boom and bust sectors, such as mining.</p>\n<h4><strong>Costs outweigh return </strong></h4>\n<p>Sometimes property investors have to spend a lot to make their investment habitable for tenants or to improve its value when the property is sold. These costs could outweigh the return you receive on your investment if they do not improve the property&rsquo;s capital growth or rentability.</p>\n<h4><strong>Unable to sell or lease </strong></h4>\n<p><span>Property investors face the risk that their investment will not appeal to buyers or renters, and that they will not receive a return on their investment as a result. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Potential return sources</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>Capital growth</strong></h4>\n<p>Capital growth is the increase in value of your property over time. If the amount your property sells for is higher than the amount you bought it for, you have achieved capital growth.</p>\n<h4><strong>Rental income</strong></h4>\n<p>Rental income is the amount your tenant pays you, usually on a monthly basis, to live in your property.</p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-example"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">CASE STUDY: Capital growth</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>Margaret bought a unit in 1993 in the Sydney suburb of Pyrmont for $300,000. In 2016, she sold that same property for $750,000. Her capital growth was $150,000.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>Where to invest: Considerations</strong></h3>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re choosing where to invest, as opposed to buying an owner-occupier property, you generally have more flexibility because the property does not have to match your taste or even be in an area you&rsquo;d like to live.</p>\n<p>Here are some factors you may wish to consider before choosing where to invest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Growth</em><strong> &ndash; </strong>Have properties in your desired area grown or fallen in value in recent years?</li>\n<li><em>Other economic factors</em><strong> &ndash; </strong>Is the area exposed to one industry? If so, is that industry on a growth trajectory? Or declining in value?</li>\n<li><em>Social factors</em><strong> &ndash; I</strong>s the area appealing to potential renters? Does it have good public transport infrastructure? Is it close to schools and medical facilities?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What is negative gearing?</strong></h3>\n<p>Investors borrow money with the intention of making a profit over a period of time on their investment. However, if you are unable to make a profit because your costs outweigh your return, that&rsquo;s called negative gearing.</p>\n<p>Investors with negatively geared properties may be able to reduce their taxable income.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Negative gearing has attracted controversy over the years, with some commentators blaming it for housing affordability problems in major capital cities.&nbsp;</p>",,700,1265,11247,11583,223355,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,26462.5,17.0

Investing in property can secure significant returns if you get it right. If your existing financial circumstances are favourable you should seek out a lender that offers this type of loan &ndash; most major banks offer them.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are </strong><strong>investment property home loan interest rates</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you decide to borrow to invest in property you'll discover that loans are similar to a conventional home loan. Not all lenders will permit borrowers to use a regular home loan for investment purposes, but most will. You're likely to discover that the interest rates offered will vary considerably if you are borrowing to invest, and that the Loan-To-Value-Rate (LTV) could be reduced from the 95&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;you might expect for a home you will live in, to 80 per cent if the loan is to be used for investment purposes.

You might also have to put down a larger deposit to secure the loan, but otherwise you should be able to source a good deal from the variety of products lenders have available. The market for investment loans is extremely competitive in Australia so you can make comparisons to work out what will be most suitable for your personal circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of </strong><strong>investment property home loan interest rates</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>You are likely to have the option to choose a fixed or variable interest rate for an investment loan. You may be eligible for a discount rate if all your financial business is with one bank, and you could also choose to have an offset account that you put money into and thus save interest on the principal amount you have borrowed. You could also opt for an interest only loan to cut down on monthly repayments. That type of loan may also be tax deductible, potentially saving you even more.</p>\n<h3><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>If you are renting out your property you need to be ready for periods of vacancy,&nbsp;when tenants leave and you have to find new ones. Tenants may also default so you need to have a strong legal agreement in place to defray any possible losses. On the plus side you will own a property that should give you a regular income to pay off your loan and, may&nbsp;increase in value over the years.&nbsp;</p>",,590,19,235,225,3133,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,450.8,147.0

If you&rsquo;d ideally like a home loan but are worried about it contravening Sharia law, take heart. There are forms of <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/islamic"">Islamic home loans</a> that mean your dream can now come true. A Sharia-compliant home loan means you can move into the property you want and gradually pay it off without compromising your religious principles.</p>\n<h3><strong>How Islamic home loans work</strong></h3>\n<p>An Islamic home loan starts when you choose a property and your lender agrees to buy it, in return for which you make a ijarah muntahiyah bittamlik agreement to live in the property for an agreed length of time and pay rent to the lender. At the end of this time, the lender will give you the property as a gift. This means that you are never actually in debt but you have a secure home that you will ultimately own. If you are willing to make higher rental payments, lenders will often agree to let you make extra payments so you can become a homeowner sooner.</p>\n<h3><strong>How Islamic home loans reflect Sharia principles</strong></h3>\n<p>Although the principle of rib€ prevents Muslims from taking out conventional home loans, because it would be wrong to pay interest, a loan like this does not require you to do so. The element of risk involved is acceptable because you will have a clear agreement operating in accordance with rules that everybody involved understands. The arrangement rewards both parties and functions as a musharakah partnership.</p>\n<h3><strong>Finding the right Islamic home loan</strong></h3>\n<p>When considering an Islamic home you will need to think carefully about what you can afford. Different lenders have different rules about the size of deposit they require from you in comparison to the value of the property they will buy. They also charge rent at different rates once you move in, so you should really speak to several lenders and compare the rates, as well as comparing any fees involved. Bear in mind that your choice is not limited to bank based in predominantly Islamic countries. Some of the larger Australian banks also offer Sharia-compliant loans.</p>\n<h3><strong>Are you eligible for a loan?</strong></h3>\n<p>Just as with other kinds of home loan, and in keeping with the principle of ghar€r, you will need to supply your lender with proof of your financial circumstances before any loan agreement can be made. You will need to show that you&rsquo;re good at managing money and that you have saved money successfully in the past (which can include money saved for your deposit). The lender will need to be persuaded that your income is adequate to pay off the loan over the term you want.</p>\n<h3><strong>Pros and cons of Islamic home loans</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Compliant with Sharia law;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No need to get into debt;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Often let you pay off the loan early;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Covered by the National Consumer Credit Protection Act;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not as much choice as with other kinds of home loan;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can be more expensive than other kinds of home loan.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",,50,0,46,35,1319,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,149.05,198.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p>There are many types of loans specifically designed to suit the lifestyle and financial needs of different people at various stages in their lives.</p>\n<p>And for those borrowers who have already built up some equity in their home but require a degree of financial flexibility, a line of credit (LOC) loan may be an effective solution to helping them meet their needs.</p>\n<h3>So how does a line of credit loan work?</h3>\n<p>Essentially, these loans function similarly to a credit card, where you are allowed to borrow up to a certain amount of money within a fixed period of time set by the lender, but there are significant points of differentiation from other loans, based on how borrowers can manage the process of their withdrawals and repayments.</p>\n<p>The key features of the line of credit loan are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the life of the loan you can withdraw money as you need it and you do not need to notify the lender what the funds are being used for each time you withdraw.</li>\n<li>As you pay back the principal amount, your&nbsp;creditamount continues to revolve and you can use those line of funds again as you need to withdraw money. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>You only make repayments based on how much you borrow, against your maximum, pre-approved amount. This is where the line of credit is similar to repaying debt on a credit card.</li>\n<li>You can pay back any amount as long as you make the minimum monthly payments set by the lender. Minimum payments may be a combination of interest and principal, or interest only.</li>\n<li>As the loan structure is not viewed as traditional in nature, the interest rate is usually set above the standard variable rate by banks and financial institutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How does a line of credit loan differ to a personal loan?</h3>\n<p>The line of credit loan is different to a personal loan, where you get a lump sum and you agree a fixed or variable interest rate and have a fixed term for repayment.</p>\n<p>As a line of credit loan is secured against your home equity, unlike a personal loan which is often unsecured, the interest rate on a line of credit loan is usually lower than on a personal loan.</p>\n<h3>How does a line of credit loan differ from a credit card?</h3>\n<p>As with a personal loan, the interest rate on the line of credit loan is also generally lower than that on a credit card, which is why some borrowers choose to opt for this loan, rather than simply increasing their existing credit card limit or taking on a credit card.</p>\n<h3>What would you use line of credit loan for?&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>In many cases, line of credit loans are used by people whose borrowing needs vary and who therefore want some flexibility around withdrawals and repayments.</p>\n<p>These types of loans are often used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home renovations and repairs</li>\n<li>Buying another property</li>\n<li>Taking a holiday</li>\n<li>Buying a car</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, you may have equity in your home and are considering whether you do a major renovation or make a series of repairs and minor alterations.</p>\n<p>You don't necessarily know how much money you will need, so opening a line of credit can give you the flexibility to pursue your project knowing you can draw down sufficient money to complete it.</p>\n<h3>Being smart about your line of credit loan</h3>\n<p>Financial discipline and organisation will help you manage your debt on a line of credit loan. There are several simple ways you can utilise its features to your full advantage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One common way of reducing the cost of the loan is to have your income deposited into your line of credit loan account to offset the overall loan amount. That way the interest on the loan is only calculated on the remaining balance of the account, which will lower your overall interest charges.</li>\n<li>Likewise, any planned or unexpected income that you receive, such as a tax refund, can also be deposited into the account as an additional repayment which contributes to reducing the interest payable.</li>\n<li>Another possible way to manage the loan effectively may be to set repayment amounts above the specified amount as part of your regular fortnightly or monthly budgets. This limits the tendency to use more of the funds without thinking of the financial ramifications<strong>.</strong></li>\n<li>Always remain conscious of the original estimated value of your home that the approved loan amount was based upon. If property values in your area or those within the property market in general are not increasing, be prudent in your use of the line of credit loan so your home equity still remains a comfortable proportion of the total value of your home, against the size of the outstanding loan amount.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What should I be aware of with these loans?</h3>\n<p>As with every loan, it&rsquo;s worth evaluating not only the benefits of the loan but also the potential risks, such as the high interest rate attached to these loans compared to other more traditional loans.</p>\n<p>Some tips to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember that this loan is most suited to those who are financially disciplined and remain committed to making regular repayments and gradually reducing the loan.</li>\n<li>This may not be an appropriate solution for those borrowers who see the loan as a quick fix to a funding shortfall. Those borrowers may find they are still overstretched financially and then have continual problems with their repayment schedule.</li>\n<li>You need a good credit rating to apply for these loans, so before you submit any applications, check your rating and determine whether you can do anything to improve it. The better it is, the greater the likelihood you'll have of being offered a lower interest rate.</li>\n<li>As with a standard variable loan, the interest rate on a line of credit loan is vulnerable to the overall market movements of the interest rate environment. Ensure you have a realistic financial buffer in place with the loan to cushion the impact of any series of interest rate rises.</li>\n<li>Some lenders may also charge monthly or annual fees as well as application fees, valuation fees and discharge fees, so you need to factor all costs into your financial calculations when comparing line of credit loans from a range of different lenders.</li>\n<li>As with more traditional loans, if a line of credit loan isn't repaid according to the terms of the contract, the lender may be able to seize your property in order to recoup the debt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Line of credit loans are offered by most banks, credit unions and financial institutions and can be a valuable way of supporting you to manage your finances throughout stages of your life where you require some flexibility as you continue to work towards your goals.</p>\n<p>However, with an increasing number of loans to choose from, comprehensive research remains the key to determining which loan will be most appropriate for you and your particular circumstances.</p>",,1600,27,391,351,15195,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1804.3,70.0

In fact, some people manage to do it even when their income is very low. If you get the right deal then it can work out cheaper than renting and make it easier for you to support yourself independently in the long term. All you need to do is compare the financial products designed for people in your situation and identify one that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why a low income doesn&rsquo;t need to stop you buying a home</strong></h3>\n<p>When you apply for a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/low-income"">low-income home loan</a>, what the lender wants to know is that you will be capable of paying it back as agreed. Being on a low income could make this harder and mean the lender, facing extra risk, asks you to agree to things like taking out lenders' mortgage insurance or extending the loan over a longer term to make the monthly payments smaller. But income isn&rsquo;t the only factor lenders consider. If you have good credit, you&rsquo;ve shown that you can stick to payment plans in the past and you have low monthly outgoings, they may be very happy to have your custom.</p>\n<h3><strong>Sources of income</strong></h3>\n<p>Although your earnings are the main factor lenders use to work out what you can pay, they may also take into account other income sources, such as Centrelink benefits and government payments. If you receive a pension, have a small inheritance, receive royalties for creative work or have rental income coming in from another property, all those things can count. You will need to provide documentary proof of all your income and three to six months&rsquo; worth of bank statements so that the lender can be clear on exactly how much you have at your disposal.</p>\n<h3><strong>Homeowner costs</strong></h3>\n<p>In order to work out how much you can safely borrow, lenders will look at your day-to-day living costs. They will also factor in new costs you will have as a homeowner, such as insurance, maintenance and repair fees and the cost of buying the furniture you need. You can make a good impression and increase your chances of acceptance by showing that you have already anticipated these costs and worked out how to cover them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ways to make it easier</strong></h3>\n<p>There are various other ways that you can improve your chances of being offered a loan despite having a low income. Borrowing less will reduce the risk the lender faces and make it easier to demonstrate that you know how to live within your means. Asking for a longer loan term means you will pay more overall but your monthly payments will be more manageable, and you may have the option of refinancing later if your income rises and you decide that you want to pay it off sooner.&nbsp; You will also be accepted more easily if you are able to put down a higher than average deposit or are making a joint application.</p>",,170,10,90,77,4811,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,528.1500000000001,135.0

Home loan lenders have a range of criteria in terms of what they consider eligibility for a loan, but&nbsp;if you're a student or have a part time income there is no reason you can't look at the options available.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>What are </strong><strong>low income and guarantor home loans</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>These loans are evaluated by lenders to ensure they are as financially comfortable as possible, so that you will be able to repay the amount loaned and not default. Your lender will therefore assess your capacity to repay and will look at your income, any savings you have and your expenses. These will include utility bills as well as other loan repayments. If a lender considers you can service your loan you may be able to move ahead, but if not you could put forward a guarantor. If you're a student or are on a low income a guarantor can make the difference between getting a loan and being refused. Usually it will be parents that act as guarantors.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do </strong><strong>low income and guarantor home loans</strong><strong> compare to other products?</strong></h3>\n<p>This may depend on what the guarantor is being asked to do. If it's for a down payment you may be offered a good deal, but many lenders look for a guarantor for the whole life of the loan. When you are researching your options for l<span>ow income and guarantor loans</span> you should look carefully at the requirements both for you and your guarantor. You should also discuss options with your guarantor so they know exactly what their obligations are. The lender will want to know your financial situation as well as your guarantor's and will make a decision based on the joint income rather than just your own.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of </strong><strong>low income and guarantor home loans</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>Lenders will be focused on the ability to pay back this type of home loan so you may find that interest rates, fixed or variable, may be higher than others. Yet there are a number of lenders who would like to get new customers, especially those who are younger and have guarantor support. It may give you the option to negotiate over interest rates, especially if a lender considers you will be a loyal future customer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong></h3>\n<p>Your guarantor will carry the main risk. If you default on payments then the guarantor will be liable and you should talk this through with whoever is supporting you. Taking out this type of home loan is neither more nor less risky than any other loan but your lender will consider it more of a risk. Your risk is less if you have a guarantor, as they will be liable for your debt if you default, for whatever reason.</p>",,5,6,19,20,1404,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,149.75,197.0

After all, the smaller your home loan repayments, the more affordable your loan will be, and the less of an impact it will make on your finances.</span></p>\n<p><span>But a low interest rate isn&rsquo;t the only factor to keep in mind when selecting a home loan.

If you don&rsquo;t take this into account when planning your budget, you could find yourself paying much more than you initially expected.</span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s also important to remember that many lenders also charge fees with their mortgages, which can make a significant impact on any borrower&rsquo;s budget. A mortgage with a low interest rate and high fees may ultimately turn out to be more expensive in total than a mortgage with a higher interest rate and lower fees and charges.</span></p>\n<p><span>One fast way to get an approximate idea of the relative costs of different loans is to look at their Comparison Rates, which combine their advertised interest rates with their standard fees and charges. However, you should keep in mind that a loan&rsquo;s comparison rate may not take its nonstandard fees and charges into account, or any bonus features offered by the lender that could add extra value to the loan. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Are you an investor?</span></h3>\n<p style=""text-align: center;""><span><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161209100446/property-investment-1.jpeg""> <img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-60258"" alt=""Real estate"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161209100446/property-investment-1.jpeg"" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span>Lenders offer different types of home loans to owner occupiers and to investors, to better suit the different financial positions of these property purchasers. </span></p>\n<p><span>While there are always exceptions, home loans for owner occupiers tend to have lower interest rates on average than investment home loans.

But keep in mind that the mortgage&rsquo;s low interest rate may not stay that low forever!</span></p>\n<p><span>Many mortgages have variable interest rates, where the amount of interest the lender charges is affected by the national cash rate set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). If the RBA keeps the cash rate on hold, the amount of interest you pay should remain steady. If the cash rate is cut, your lender should pass the interest cut on to you, reducing your home loan repayments. However, the RBA may also choose to increase the cash rate, which could lead to your interest payments becoming more expensive if your lender passes on this rate rise. A sustained period of regular rate rises could lead to your mortgage repayments growing much more expensive than what they were originally, potentially putting you at risk of mortgage stress.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders fix their mortgage interest rates for anywhere from one to twelve years. This can help to keep your repayments stable and comfortably affordable during the fixed period, which can prove especially valuable to first home buyers hoping to build up their initial equity. However, with one of these fixed rate home loans, you also won&rsquo;t benefit from any savings if the RBA lowers the cash rate.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>How will you choose?</h6>\n<h3>The fixed versus variable home loan debate</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/articles/the-fixed-versus-variable-home-loan-debate"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re uncertain which option will best suit your finances, you may be able to choose a split rate home loan, which involves paying a fixed rate of interest on a percentage of your loan&rsquo;s principal, and a variable rate on the remaining balance. This lets you enjoy some of the advantages of a variable rate mortgage, such as savings from rate cuts, while at the same time benefiting from the security of a fixed interest rate, which can help keep your repayments from getting too high if rates rise.</span></p>\n<h3>Mortgage stress explained</h3>\n<p>Earlier, we explained that borrowers can run the risk of mortgage stress if interest rates increase. But what is mortgage stress?</p>\n<p>The definition of mortgage stress is when a household has to devote at least 30 per cent of its pre-tax income to servicing its mortgage.</p>\n<p>Households that are coping reasonably well with their&nbsp;<a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">mortgage repayments</a>&nbsp;can find themselves suffering mortgage stress if interest rates suddenly increase, or increase by a significant amount in a short period of time.</p>\n<p>It can happen. For example, between October 2009 and November 2010, the Reserve Bank of Australia increased the official&nbsp;<a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate"">cash rate</a>&nbsp;by 1.50 percentage points. Imagine if you took out a home loan at, say, 4.50 per cent, and your lender then increased your interest rate by 1.50 percentage points over the next 13 months. Here&rsquo;s what would happen if you had a 30-year loan for $350,000, $500,000, $650,000 or $800,000:</p>\n<div class=""table-responsive"">\n<table class=""table table-striped"">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th><strong>$350,000</strong></th>\n<th><strong>$500,000</strong></th>\n<th><strong>$650,000</strong></th>\n<th><strong>$800,000</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Monthly repayments at 4.50%</td>\n<td>$1,773</td>\n<td>$2,533</td>\n<td>$3,293</td>\n<td>$4,053</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monthly repayments at 6.00%</td>\n<td>$2,098</td>\n<td>$2,998</td>\n<td>$3,897</td>\n<td>$4,796</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increase</td>\n<td>$325</td>\n<td>$465</td>\n<td>$604</td>\n<td>$743</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h3><span>Choosing your loan term</span></h3>\n<p><span><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161209101114/money-hourglass.jpeg""> <img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" alt=""Hourglass and dollar shadow"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161209101114/money-hourglass.jpeg"" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re looking at low interest home loans to hopefully minimise how much interest you&rsquo;ll pay on a property, then you may also want to consider the length of time that you&rsquo;ll take to pay off your loan. Many mortgages start with terms of 25 or 30 years, though shorter and longer loan terms exist. </span></p>\n<p><span>By paying back your mortgage over a longer term, you&rsquo;ll be making a larger number of repayments, each one for a smaller percentage of the principal. This can help to keep your repayments on the low side, so your mortgage remains more affordable from month to month. However, more repayments means more interest charges, so you may ultimately pay more in total interest over the longer loan term than if you&rsquo;d opted for a shorter term.</span></p>\n<p><span>A shorter loan term involves paying off your principal over a shorter period. Fewer repayments means fewer interest charges over the lifetime of the loan, so you can ultimately pay less interest on top of your loan&rsquo;s principal. However, this does mean that each repayment will be for a larger percentage of your loan principal, making your mortgage less affordable from month to month.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>See how loan term affects repayments:</h6>\n<h3>Home Loan Calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">Find Out</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><span>Your deposit</span></h3>\n<p><span><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161028092931/mortgage-deposit-jar.jpg""> <img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" alt=""mortgage-deposit-jar"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161028092931/mortgage-deposit-jar.jpg"" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span>Most lenders require a certain amount of money up-front to serve as security when you apply for a home loan. This amount varies by lender, but around 20% of the value is not uncommon. If you&rsquo;re looking for a low interest rate, you&rsquo;ll likely need to pay the full deposit to help reduce the lender&rsquo;s risk. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you can&rsquo;t afford a full deposit on the mortgage you&rsquo;re looking at, there may be other options available to you. Some lenders can offer a mortgage with a higher Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), where you pay a smaller deposit and borrow a greater percentage of the property&rsquo;s value instead. However, for these options you&rsquo;ll likely be required to pay the extra expense of Lender&rsquo;s Mortgage Insurance (LMI) to help protect the lender in case you default on your repayments.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>How much could your LMI cost?</h6>\n<h3>Lender Mortgage Insurance (LMI) Calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://ratecity.com.au/home-loans/lmi-calculator"">Find Out</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>One option to avoid pricey LMI is a Guarantor loan, where a close relative guarantees your home loan with the equity in their own property in lieu of the full deposit.

Any money that&rsquo;s paid into this account is included when the lender calculates its interest charges, which can help you save some money.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-example"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">Example:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve paid back <strong>$200,000</strong> of a <strong>$500,000</strong> home loan, and have <strong>$15,000</strong> in your offset account, your interest repayments will be calculated on a remaining balance of <strong>$285,000</strong> rather than <strong>$300,000</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>A redraw facility will allow you to withdraw surplus money from your mortgage, provided you&rsquo;re ahead on your repayments. This can allow you to confidently make extra payments onto your home loan, without worrying about finding yourself short on funds in case of emergency. Even if you never use the redraw facility, paying extra money onto your home loan will bring you closer to paying it off ahead of schedule and potentially saving money in interest payments. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Do banks or non-banks offer the lowest interest rates?</span></h3>\n<p><span><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161209102516/bank-and-nonbank.jpeg""> <img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" alt=""Office, business tools with dollars and calculator on table"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161209102516/bank-and-nonbank.jpeg"" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span>When looking at interest rates on their own, in many cases the non-bank lenders will make the lower offers than the banks to stay competitive. And as these lenders are often smaller organisations than the big banks, they may be able to offer more personalised services to their customers, or offer more flexible lending criteria to better suit a wider range of borrowers. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, just because a mortgage has a low interest rate doesn&rsquo;t mean it will necessarily offer the greatest value. Larger banks are often able to offer full home loan packages, bundling the bank&rsquo;s full range of services (transaction/savings accounts, credit cards etc.) along with the mortgage. Plus, with most banks you&rsquo;ll have the option to visit a branch to talk over your home loan, which may not be possible with some online-only lenders.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Compare low interest mortgages</span></h3>\n<p><span>When choosing a home loan to suit your unique financial situation, low interest rates are just one of many available factors to consider.

It always involves making compromises so you will need to think carefully about which type is appropriate for you. The best <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/low-rate"">low rate home loan</a> for your circumstances may be different from the best one for somebody else. Finding the right one, however, can make your life much easier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Understanding rates</strong></h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s natural to compare the products you see offered by the interest rate they advertise when you&rsquo;re looking for a low rate loan. This can be misleading because sometimes loans that are promoted as having low interest rates have high annual fees that mean you would end up paying more overall. The best thing to do is to use the comparison rate, which takes most fees into account as well, and is designed to make it easier for you to see the best deal at a glance.</p>\n<h3><strong>Extra features</strong></h3>\n<p>Lenders that offer low rate home loans usually do so by cutting back on extra features like credit cards and free early repayments. To get the best low rate loan for your circumstances, you&rsquo;ll need to think carefully about which extra features are really important to you. A lot of borrowers get by without any at all.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fixed rate loans</strong></h3>\n<p>Fixed rate loans often have slightly higher basic rates but can be a better choice for people on a tight budget because outgoings remain predictable and there will be no sudden rises. Having this security can make it easier to use other money in your possession, rather than having to keep a float in case of a sudden rate rise.&nbsp;Often borrowers look to lock in a fixed rate with the official RBA cash rate is low.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Variable rate loans</strong></h3>\n<p>Variable rate loans usually offer the lowest interest rates on the market but entail more risk, so they can be a great way to save money, but they&rsquo;re not always the best choice for people on low incomes. If the national interest rate is high and is expected to fall it can be a good time to take out a variable rate loan because you will then see your rates fall and will be able to take advantage of the changing situation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Main considerations</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Is the interest rate offered as good as it looks or are there hidden charges?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is it really worth your while to pay for additional features?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is it worth getting a lower rate now if it means you may have to pay more later?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How much risk can you afford to take in order to take advantage of market variability?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can you afford to pay more overall by accepting a longer loan term to keep your monthly payments low?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",,880,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,88.0,227.5

Upfront fees are clear and obvious ways home loan providers recoup some of the cost of their investment when providing the loan to you. Low upfront fees are one way in which home loan providers attract people to sign up to a particular home loan. These, however, may have higher interest rates long term or have extra hidden fees along the way. It is imperative that you <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare""><span>research</span></a> all sides of the home loan including upfront costs before committing to a home loan.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the types of upfront fees?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are many types of upfront fees home loan providers can attach to a loan. They will vary on cost and type depending on the provider and whether you have chosen a fixed or variable interest home loan. The home loan application, sometimes called the establishment fee, will in most cases be an upfront fee charged by the home loan provider. These fees can sometimes be considerable and are compulsory before the loan can be moved onto the next stage.</p>\n<p>A valuation fee, charged for the cost of an accredited valuer to access you property, may be separate to the application fee or be coupled with it. Similarly, the home loan provider&rsquo;s legal fees may also be included in the initial fee or as an additional fee. Also, depending on your situation, you may have to pay the lender&rsquo;s mortgage insurance fee. This protects your home loan provider if you default on your loan and it will depend on the size of your loan and the value of your property.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Which home loans come with low upfront fees?</strong></h2>\n<p>While many&nbsp;home loans come with some upfront fees or administration fees, it is possible to locate home loans with minimal upfront charges.&nbsp;Most home loan providers will require you to pay an upfront application fee that may be reduced to be competitive with other providers. However, if you are not asked to pay this upfront fee there could be increased or hidden fees or charges during the life of the loan. Some <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/low-upfront-fees""><span>mortgage comparison websites</span></a> do have the option to compare upfront fees and are a clear and quick way to compare costs.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Should I get a home loan with low upfront fees?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Home loans with low upfront fees do not suit everyone. Before making a decision you should look at the overall costs of the home loan from beginning to end. While one home loan may look cheaper due to decreased upfront fees, these types of loans may have higher interest rates or more ongoing fees. All costs should be compared before entering into a loan agreement.</p>",,5,0,11,12,895,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,93.45,221.0

Because the lower the interest rate, the less money you&rsquo;ll hand over to your bank every month. For this reason finding the lowest home loan rates is important in making sure you are getting a good deal.</p>\n<p>A home loan is a long-term commitment so it&rsquo;s a good idea to research and compare the interest rates available. See what each lender is offering and compare each product to work out whether you are getting a good deal.</p>\n<p><strong>Should I take out a variable home loan?</strong></p>\n<p>Also keepx in mind that if you opt for a variable home loan you will be subject to fluctuating interest rates. This means that while you may be choosing one of the lowest home loan rates now it could go up in the future. With that said, there are also advantages to a variable home loan, because if the interest rate drops you&rsquo;ll find yourself with more money in your pocket every month.</p>\n<p>Compare variable rate home loans below and read further information on the <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/articles/fixed-vs-variable-rate-loans"">difference between fixed and variable loans.</a></p>\n<p><strong>What if the rate is just an introductory offer?</strong></p>\n<p>When looking at which home loan has the lowest interest rate remember that some low rates are only an introductory offer. These low rate home loan offers come with an expiry date and when your time is up you could be hit with high interest rates for the rest of the loan.</p>\n<p>While this can be a good way of easing yourself into home loan payments, especially for first home buyers, check the revert rate against the average mortgage interest rate to make sure you&rsquo;re not getting yourself into a bad deal.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some other important features of a loan?</strong></p>\n<p>Other features of a mortgage are just as important as getting the lowest home loan rate so don&rsquo;t let yourself be blinded by a seemingly great deal. If you have plans to use a redraw facility on your mortgage, or to be able to make extra repayments towards your principal, check that it will be possible with the loan that you choose.</p>\n<p>You may also want to see if you can make lump sum repayments towards your home loan at any time without incurring an extra fee.

The city is one of the country&rsquo;s cultural capitals with contemporary art, dance, theatre, film and television industries being based there. The city is also well known for its changeable weather conditions, with strong winds, heavy rain and hail events. Melbourne is regarded as a highly liveable city with a well-designed attractive centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the property market like in Melbourne?</strong></h2>\n<p>Properties are always in high demand in Melbourne. Prices for properties are growing, with affordability and shortage of supply a problem for people wanting to live in the city. The affordability issues increase the closer you move to the Melbourne CBD.</p>\n<p>Due to the city&rsquo;s location on a natural bay, there is also a shortage of land for large developments and residential housing. There are also a larger proportion of units, apartments and townhouses in the city, with these types of properties being more affordable that detached houses. Rental properties are in high demand with steadily increasing rents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the difference between home loans in Melbourne and other major cities in Australia?</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;The property market and <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">home loan</a> sector is regulated by the Australian Government on a national basis, therefore the process is similar when getting a home loan in Melbourne as in the other state capitals and major metropolitan centres. It is perhaps easier to access a wide variety of home loan providers in Melbourne than in some other smaller Australian towns and cities. Because of the high demand for property you will need to organise your home loan quickly, otherwise a property you want to purchase could be snapped up by another buyer.</p>\n<h2><strong>What do I need to know about getting a home loan in Melbourne?</strong></h2>\n<p>The home loan process in Melbourne is similar to other states with the usual stamp duty and land taxes charged by the Victorian state government. If you are looking to purchase land or to make major renovations to a property these areas are governed by the Melbourne City Council. There are many building codes, restrictions and regulations that apply when building or renovating a property in this city.

This may seem obvious but you need to put your overall budget together very carefully so that you don't get an unpleasant surprise in the months and years to come. The cost of your mortgage repayments need to be set in the context of all your other outgoings, and then you are ready to look for the most affordable mortgages Australia.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are </strong><strong>most affordable mortgages in Australia</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>There are a wide variety of mortgages available in Australia and your financial circumstances will dictate how much you will be able to afford. It's easy to think of your mortgage outgoings as the only expense you will have in terms of your home loan but there are many other considerations. When you start your search be aware that some lenders my charge an upfront application fee, so as well as the deposit you put down you may need to free up some extra money at the beginning of the agreement.

The state government offers several incentives if you are a first time buyer or are intending to build a property. These benefits should be fully researched before you consider getting a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">home loan</a> as they can substantially reduce costs or can add to your initial deposit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the property market like in NSW?</strong></h2>\n<p>Although figures fluctuate depending on market changes, the property market in NSW is generally more driven than in other states. The state has a high level of industry with both national and multinational companies based there and is therefore highly attractive to job seekers. The average income in NSW is also higher than in most states and is experiencing steady growth. This has pushed house prices up, with buyers now having more to spend on properties. Units and townhouses have also become a better option for potential homeowners with a greater availability of these housing types than traditional detached houses.</p>\n<h2><strong>What influences getting a property in NSW?</strong></h2>\n<p>As an attractive lifestyle option for many job seekers, NSW in recent years has experienced high demand for property and a housing shortage. This is compounded by the limited amount of land available to develop.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you are considering buying a property in NSW you will need a larger deposit than in most states and must be prepared to <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">spend</a> more due to the high demand that is driving prices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Due to the demand for both rental and properties to purchase in NSW, the state has become attractive for foreign and local investors wanting to capitalise on the booming market. This can make it even more difficult for first time buyers or those inexperienced in the property market to purchase properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Are there any home loan incentive schemes in NSW?</strong></h2>\n<p>The NSW government offers several incentive schemes for people looking to get onto the property ladder. However, you will need to fulfil specific criteria to be eligible for these programs. The government assists first home buyers with a variety of incentives and grant programs. For you to be successful in these programs, in most cases you will have to either purchase or build a new home. Currently, the First Home Owner Grant (New Homes) Scheme and NSW New Home Grant Scheme are two such schemes. These often change and should be fully researched to understand what is on offer.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the added costs of getting a home loan in NSW?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Both state and council laws and regulations control purchasing a property in NSW. Depending on the council region your property is in you may need to pay initial application costs as well as ongoing rates and charges. In all states you will need to pay a stamp duty on the purchase of a property. This will depend on the value of the property and the state in which it is located. NSW stamp duty costs are similar to other states with comparable population and industry.</p>",,90,0,8,7,592,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,70.45,242.0

You'll always pay some type of fee for a mortgage but an application can cost between $200 and $1000; the charge will depend on the home loan offered. But if you look around you may well be able to find <span>home loans with no application fees</span>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>What are </strong><strong>home loans with no application fees</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>Because lenders are in a highly competitive market some do not charge for home loan applications. This can be the case with a number of home loan products:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Package home loans:</strong> this type of loan bundles together all your borrowings, including credit cards, and keeps all your banking requirements under one roof. Application and other upfront fees may be waived but you're likely to be charged an annual fee.</li>\n<li><strong>Special promotions:</strong> lenders are always looking to attract new borrowers so may offer a special promotion whereby the usual application fee is waived to get you to sign up.</li>\n<li><strong>Basic home loans: </strong>these often don't have many special features and thus there may be no application fee, and other fees may also be lower.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>How do </strong><strong>home loans with no application fees </strong><strong>compare to other products?</strong></h3>\n<p>This is where you really need to do your homework. Remember that nothing is ever completely free. You will always pay some kind of fee for your home loan, depending on the kind of features offered with the loan, which could include offset accounts or split rate options. Not paying an application fee means you will have a little more money upfront that you could spend on furnishing your new home, but you should always look at the interest rates charged for this type of product and what other fees, including legal ones, there may be.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of </strong><strong>home loans with no application fees</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are a first time homebuyer and have saved up the appropriate deposit then you'll be looking to cut down as far as possible on your upfront expenses for a <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/fixed-rate"">home loan</a></span>. So a home loan without an application fee can be an attractive option. This sort of loan may come with other strings attached, perhaps in the form of a slightly higher than usual interest rate or an annual fee. You should always build these facts into your budgeting to see if you really are getting the best deal in the long term.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are always pros and cons for all types of home loans. For home loans with no application fees you could save many hundreds of dollars in fees at the beginning of your loan and choose from a good number of products that don't charge up front to apply. Bear in mind that you could be charged expensive fees for other items such as a valuation, settling your loan or for legal costs. Make comparisons and weigh up your options before you make a final decision.&nbsp;</p>",,50,0,5,4,135,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,19.85,325.0

While some home loans have low minimum deposit amounts, you will not be able to borrow from most lenders without providing a deposit or another guarantee.</span></p>\n<p><span>While you&rsquo;re unlikely to find a 100% no-deposit home loan in Australia, there are home loan options available with alternative security options. You may not need to save a huge lump sum for these home loans, though they typically have other risks and challenges to consider. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Why do banks want you to pay a deposit?</span></h3>\n<p><span>Whenever a bank lends money, they run the risk that the borrower might not pay it back, leaving the bank out of pocket. To protect their finances, banks usually require borrowers to pay a percentage of their loan&rsquo;s value up front as a deposit. If the borrower defaults on their loan repayments, this deposit helps to minimise the bank&rsquo;s losses. </span></p>\n<p><span>The higher the deposit you can afford when applying for a home loan, the less of a risk the bank will deem you to be. Being a low-risk borrower can bring many financial benefits, such as lower interest rates, or access to flexible loan features.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Can you afford a mortgage?</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">Home Loan Calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">Find Out</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><span>Low-deposit home loans and Lender&rsquo;s Mortgage Insurance</span></h3>\n<p><span>If you have some savings available, but not enough to afford a full deposit, you may be able to opt for a home loan that only requires a smaller minimum&nbsp;deposit.</span></p>\n<p><span>But while low-deposit home loans may sound more affordable than higher-deposit options, there may be other costs involved. One of the most significant and most frequently encountered is Lender&rsquo;s Mortgage Insurance (LMI).</span></p>\n<p><span>LMI is an insurance policy that protects the lender&rsquo;s finances in case the borrower defaults on their repayments. It only covers the lender, and not the borrower &ndash; borrowers looking to insure their repayments against financial hardship may want to search for Mortgage Protection Insurance. Because the lender typically passes the cost of LMI on to the borrower, LMI can add thousands of dollars to the total cost of buying a home.</span></p>\n<p><span>LMI is based on your mortgage&rsquo;s Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) &ndash; an expression of the amount being borrowed compared to the value of the property. LMI is usually required for most home loans with an LVR higher than 80% &ndash; that is, a loan where the borrower pays a deposit of less than 20% of the property&rsquo;s value. Some specialised loan types from different lenders have higher or lower LVR requirements for LMI.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Do you need a deposit with a guarantor?</span></h3>\n<p><span>If you can&rsquo;t afford a home loan deposit, it may still be possible to apply for a no deposit home loan by getting some help from a guarantor - a third party who guarantees your loan by volunteering to take responsibility for your debt if you&rsquo;re unable to pay it yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span>Guarantor loans may not require a deposit from the borrower, but they typically require the guarantor to meet certain standards. Because banks rely on borrowers and guarantors having close relationships, most banks will only accept the parents of the borrower as guarantors, though some lenders will accept other relatives, including grandparents, spouses and siblings.</span></p>\n<p><span>A guarantor may need to pay the deposit on behalf of the borrower, or use the equity in their own property as security. Other requirements for guarantors can include being an Australian citizen or permanent resident, having a good credit rating, or having a steady income and/or savings available. </span></p>\n<p><span>Becoming a guarantor is a major commitment. If the borrower fails to repay the loan for any reason, the guarantor will be required to cover the debts, which could see them lose their own house and/or savings. What&rsquo;s more, guaranteeing a home loan (even for a reliable borrower) can affect a guarantor&rsquo;s credit rating, making it more difficult for them to qualify for loans of their own. </span></p>\n<div class=""rc-embed-widget"" data-rc-colour=""63738c"" data-rc-url=""//blaze.ratecity.com.au/widgets/compare/home-loans/big4/macquarie-bank@2/basic-p-i-variable-above-80-150-749k-90?h_maxBorrowingAmount=250000&h_maxLoanTerm=30""></div>\n<script src=""//blaze.ratecity.com.au/blaze-assets/embedWidget.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>\n<h3><span>Borrowing with equity</span></h3>\n<p><span>Borrowers who already have a home loan may be able to take out a new mortgage without paying a deposit. Instead, they can secure their loan using the equity in their current property. </span></p>\n<p><span>Equity is the value of a property that the borrower owns outright &ndash; the total value of a property minus the amount still owing on the mortgage. The more of a mortgage&rsquo;s principal the borrower pays back, the more equity the borrower has in the property. What&rsquo;s more, properties in areas that experience significant capital growth (e.g. rising house prices, high demand) can further grow their mortgage-holder&rsquo;s equity. </span></p>\n<p><span>Equity can be used in place of a deposit to secure or guarantee a home loan, whether it&rsquo;s a new home loan to refinance the current one, or an all new loan to purchase a second <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/investment-property"">investment property</a>.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Match your home loan to your finances</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">Refinancing Home Loans</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""#"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>The biggest risk involved when using equity to secure a home loan is that if you default on the loan, you lose the equity, which means having your property repossessed by the lender to recover the costs. </span></p>\n<h3><span>How to save for a house deposit</span></h3>\n<p><span>If want a home loan but have no money saved for a deposit, there are ways make the saving process seem less daunting.</span></p>\n<p><span>Budgeting your incoming and outgoing expenses is one good way to start saving for a home loan. Spend a month recording money going into and out of your account, and work out how much you have left over to save at the end. From there, you can take a critical look at what you spend your money on, and cut down on any unnecessary expenses.</span></p>\n<p><span>Keeping your money in a high-interest savings account can also help you reach your goal faster. The more money you put away in an account with a high interest rate, the more interest you can earn, so try to keep all your savings in the one place if possible. It&rsquo;s also important to maintain a high enough minimum balance that you make more money in interest per year than the loan&rsquo;s annual fee will cost you. </span></p>",,4400,455,2311,2200,127357,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,14079.85,29.0

Search and apply for Home Loans against Australia's top lenders on RateCity.,,,,,,"<h2>No doc home loans</h2>\n    <p>'No doc' home loans refer to a type of loan that requires no documentation to gain approval from the lender. For example, someone who is self-employed or works on a contract basis and has limited proof of income might find themselves with little or no appropriate documentation to apply for a home loan.</p>\n    <p>Some financial institutions will often refuse to lend to customers with low or no documentation as they are deemed to be ‰Û÷high-risk‰Ûª. Fortunately however, some lenders specialise in this type of loan, providing viable options for anyone in this situation. It is often a requirement of these specialist lenders that an ABN is provided as proof of a registered business that the borrower owns.</p>\n    <p>As it is an increased risk for these lenders to take on customers who have no proof of income, you might be asked for a large deposit. It‰Ûªs also likely you‰Ûªll be charged a higher interest rate offset this risk.</p>\n    <h2>Low doc home loans</h2>\n    <p>Low doc home loans are similar to no doc home loans except they do require people to provide some level of documentation before their home loan will be approved. Like the no doc home loan, customers who borrow money using this option will be considered high-risk borrowers as they will have limited proof of income.</p>\n    <p>As such, these loans generally charge higher interest rates and require larger deposits much like no doc loans. In some cases a lender may also require that the loan is secured against an asset of the borrower‰Ûªs for extra security. This may be a property that they already own or a vehicle that the bank would repossess in the event that the mortgage repayments could not be made.</p>\n    <h2>Choosing a no doc home loan</h2>\n    <p>When choosing a home loan there are several important factors to consider. The interest rate offered by the lender should be taken into consideration as a high interest rate can add thousands to your loan that wouldn‰Ûªt otherwise have to pay. As no doc home loans traditionally have high interest rates it will take some research of the market to find the best deal.</p>\n    <p>Aside from the interest rate, it is important to look at the other fees and expenses associated with the no doc home loan you are considering. An easy way of doing this is to look at the comparison rate of the home loan as this will give you a better idea of the overall cost of the loan inclusive of the interest rate and some fees.</p>\n    <p>Before committing to a home loan, it‰Ûªs also important to find out what features are offered by the lender. For example, some loans offer a redraw or offset facility that may help reduce the amount of interest you pay over time.</p>",,170,56,377,424,10994,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1264.5500000000002,90.0

Most redraw facilities place a minimum limit on the amount of funds you can withdraw, but <span>home loans with no minimum redraw amount</span> can give you more flexibility.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>What are </strong><strong>home loans with no minimum redraw amount</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>When you take out a home loan with a redraw facility you have the opportunity to pay off your debt more quickly by making extra repayments on top of your usual monthly mortgage payment. When you make additional repayments the principal sum is reduced and you could pay off your loan more quickly as interest is also reduced. A redraw facility also allows you to withdraw extra repayments, not payments made to the original loan. Home loans with no minimum redraw amount allow you to take out whatever you need without having to comply with a minimum amount requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>How do </strong><strong>home loans with no minimum redraw amount </strong><strong>compare to other products?</strong></h3>\n<p>Access to the extra repayments you have made to your home loan is a key area to be clear about. You should investigate how many redraws you can make per year and see if there is a set number of free redraws and what the fees are for additional ones after the free ones have been made. You may want a debit card with the loan to access your funds, or have a lender that has online services or a mobile app facility so you can redraw funds using those.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of </strong><strong>home loans with no minimum redraw amount</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>Ease of access to any extra repayments you have made and the fact that you can take out as much or as little as you want are main features of this type of loan. <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">Home loans</a></span> with no minimum redraw amount are usually associated with variable rate mortgages, so you should keep a sharp eye on interest rates and watch for signs that they may move up or down. Interest rates may remain static for some time, or reduce minimally, but it depends on the volatility of the economy and what central banks determine in terms of interest rate policy. It's always worth looking for a competitive interest rate and low fees for this sort of home loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong></h3>\n<p>You should be clear about the number of times you can make withdrawals. There may be limits as to the frequency and you could also incur fees for the service. You could also risk eating away at the extra repayments you have made, so the interest you will be paying on the loan may gradually increase. On the plus side you don't have to withdraw what the lender stipulates as the minimum amount, which could be as much as $1,000. It gives you more freedom, an extra financial cushion, and the ability to decide how much you want to take.</p>",,5,0,0,0,15,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2.0,473.5

Some home loan lenders offer such a redraw option and that may be something for you to consider when deciding on a lender. Providers sometimes attach fees when you choose to redraw repayments but many offer zero fees if you have multiple loans with the provider, or have signed up to a special home loan.</p>\n<h2><strong>What does redraw mean?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Quite simply the redraw facility is the ability to access payments you have made on your loan when you&rsquo;ve made extra repayments above the minimum requirement. You can choose to make extra repayments during any part of the loan and then redraw them to use when needed. In some cases it can be difficult to determine whether a home loan provider charges redraw fees. Home loan comparison <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare""><span>websites</span></a>&nbsp;like RateCity are one of the best ways you can quickly and easily find out the basic features of home loans and they often include the redraw feature in their comparisons.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Why should you use the redraw facility?</strong></h2>\n<p>Using the redraw facility can be a great option for you, both as a way to reduce interest costs by making extra payments and as a flexible way to access funds when needed. The ability to redraw funds can be an incentive for you to make extra repayments on a home loan because you can access the funds whenever you need them. Making extra repayments is the best way to decrease the cost of the loan over its life by reducing the total amount of interest you pay. <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator""><span>Mortgage calculators</span></a> will indicate the large amounts you can save by making extra repayments. As well as saving money in the long-term, having the option to redraw can be a great way to save funds for emergencies.</p>\n<h2><strong>What redraw fees do providers charge?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are different ways in which home loan providers can charge you for the redraw facility. Many have an additional fee on the total cost of the home loan for having the option to redraw funds. Others choose to charge you a one-off fee each time you redraw funds from your home loan, or charge you each time you redraw over a specified limit. As you can see none of these home loans are &lsquo;no redraw fee&rsquo; options. Providers may also limit or restrict the amount you can redraw. The best way to prevent any future problems is to check home loan providers&rsquo; policies or use a comprehensive home loan comparison website.</p>",,210,0,5,6,193,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,41.95,278.0

Prior to this you could only get home loans from banks, building societies and credit unions. As a result it was difficult for Australians with a poor credit history and those on a low income to buy a home. After deregulation a number of non-bank lenders were able to start offering home loans at very competitive interest rates, often below those made available by the regular financial institutions. Homebuyers began to benefit from this competitive market as the banks were forced to lower their rates.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>What are non-bank lenders?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Non-bank lenders include insurance companies, investment banks, mortgage brokers and mortgage originators among others. While they don&rsquo;t hold a banking licence as such, nevertheless they are subject to the same banking regulations and laws as licensed financial institutions according to the Consumer Credit Code and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). ASIC requires all lenders to disclose all rates and fees pertaining to their products and to make this information easily available to consumers. The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) operates slightly differently in that it oversees banks for the sole purpose of ensuring that they keep to any financial promises they make.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do non-bank lenders operate?</strong></h3>\n<p>As privately owned non-mutual organisations, non-bank lenders usually rely on selling on their products in large quantities to be retailed by others. Compared to banks their services are restricted, however, they do include provision of bad credit loans, home loans, reverse mortgages, low doc loans and line of credit loans. Unlike regular banks, there are no additional features such as transaction accounts or credit cards.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why opt for home loans from non-bank lenders?</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p><span>Non-bank lenders</span> provide some advantages if you are searching for a good deal as your provider can be more flexible in terms of the fees and the interest rates they charge. This results in banks lowering rates to remain competitive and you, the consumer, benefit by sourcing more affordable home loans from a variety of financial institutions.</p>\n<p>When comparing home loans use the same criteria for non-bank lenders as for any other lender. Check your eligibility, the fees involved, the interest rates and whether the loan features are a good fit for your financial needs.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the rewards and risks?</strong></h3>\n<p>Home loans from non-bankers provide a reward for customers in that they offer flexible interest rates and great levels of service. They have become enormously popular because of this, and also because some people are dissatisfied with their experiences of banks. Non-bank lenders are conscious of the fact that many dissatisfied consumers often turn to them for an improved customer service.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One thing to be aware of if you are considering home loans from non-bank lenders is that there may be inconsistencies when it comes to passing on interest rate changes. As they have a mix of private funding and funding via banks, for example if they are managing mortgages, the rate changes could vary considerably.</p>",,40,42,355,301,6291,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,752.5,116.0

This can, in turn, influence the stability of the property market, the average prices and, therefore, the size of your <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan</a>. When buying a property in the Northern Territory you must adhere to both territory and council regulations. These include dual levels of fees and charges as well as any concessions or grants that may be of benefit to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the Northern Territory like and how will this affect me getting a home loan?</strong></h2>\n<p>Due to its location and topography, many parts of the Northern Territory are inhabitable because of minimal natural resources and climate, or are highly susceptible to natural disasters. Coastline parts of the state are often hit by cyclones and experience monsoon like rains. You should take this into account if looking to purchase property in the Northern Territory because this can affect property prices and house insurance premiums.</p>\n<p>Most of the territory&rsquo;s 200,000+ population live in the capital city, Darwin, or the other main settlements of Palmerston, Alice Springs, Katherine, Nhulunbuy and Tennant Creek. Most of the working population are employed in the tourism or mining industries. These tend to be volatile industries that fluctuate with uncontrollable international and interstate factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Does the state government offer any concessions or grants to help me get a home loan?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you are building a home, buying a new home or are in a low-income family, the Northern Territory government may provide you with rebates or grants to purchase a property. First home buyers can apply for a first home owner grant and a household goods grant if it is a new build. If you are purchasing an established property you can apply for a home renovation grant. Potential homeowners in specific groups, such as, first home owners, pensioners or low-income earners, can apply for rebates or discounts on the fees charged by the Northern Territory government.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Are there any taxes or fees when buying a property in the Northern Territory?</strong></h2>\n<p>When buying property in the Northern Territory you may have to pay both territory and council taxes and fees. Depending on the type of property or land you are purchasing you might have to pay council application fees, rates and other levies. You should consult the relevant council before purchasing the property. In many cases you will have to pay stamp duty when purchasing a property so you should ensure these fees are budgeted for before obtaining your <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">home loan</a>.

Home loan offers can be relatively easy to source, provided you can prove that you will be able to afford the repayments, and there are many companies that specialise in these types of offer. A home loan is more than likely the largest loan that you will ever take out in your lifetime, so you want to make sure you get things right from the start.</p>\n<h2>What are home loan offers?</h2>\n<p>When you start to explore your financial options for buying a home, you should take the time to research a wide variety of home loan offers. Offers constantly change, sometimes depending on economic circumstances when interest rates may be particularly low and attractive offers can be put forward to new or existing customers, or when a financial company is looking to get more business over a specific period of time. Home loan offers like these don't last forever, but you'll still discover offers made to you for your home loan.</p>\n<h2>What are the main features of home loan offers?</h2>\n<p>When you are looking for a home loan offer, there are several options for repayments that you can choose. Examine each one carefully to make sure that it's suitable for you. The three main methods to repay a home loan are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variable interest rate mortgage: you will start with an agreed interest rate, and your repayments include both the interest on the principal loan and a contribution to paying off the principal. If interest rates go up or down, your lender will usually pass on the rise or cut, in part or in full. Depending on the size of the loan, the time taken to pay everything off can be many years, but at the end you will own the property.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed interest rate mortgage: you and the company will agree to fix the interest rate for a specified period, usually between two and ten years. That means you know exactly what you will be paying every month, and when the agreement comes to an end, it may be possible to put another one in place or look for another lender.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Split interest rate mortgage: you can negotiate with your lender for a mix of the two previous rates, splitting between variable and fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Interest only mortgage: some lenders may offer this option where you just pay the interest on the principal loan, but at the end of the term that principal is outstanding and you have to pay it. Repayments will be cheaper, but you need to build up a fund to pay the principal or be prepared to sell the property and hope to make a profit. House prices generally rise, so you could do well out of it in the end.</li>\n</ul>",,110,0,16,1,60,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,19.55,326.0

Perhaps you also enjoy browsing supermarket websites, say Coles or Woolworths, for your grocery shopping. Online purchasing has become closely associated with having a wide choice and plenty of cheap deals. When it comes to searching for the best options for a home loan there are many online brands from which to choose. Some banks that have standard city centre premises also offer online only deals.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Why opt for home loans from online lenders?</strong></h3>\n<p>Most <span>home loans online lenders</span> offers are excellent value when compared to traditional borrowing opportunities. All online lenders have a secure website and this is how they communicate with their customers. They also have good call centre support often at local call rates and most feature calculators on their website. Not all online lenders have branches however all of them are adept at responding promptly to enquiries from existing and potential customers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Advantages of online home loans</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>If you browse the online loans available you will notice some helpful advantages including low or no initial application fees and often no ongoing fees either. Online interest rates are highly competitive and often lower than those offered by traditional banks. In terms of features, online lenders are usually prepared to be more flexible and to have more advanced products that are easy to manage via the telephone and the internet. Approval processes are generally fast and some online lenders include extra features with their cheaper interest loans such as split accounts, redraw facilities, offset accounts and zero fees for service.</p>\n<h3><strong>Is security an issue with online loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are feeling uncertain about banking online for security reasons always check that the lender has an Australian Credit Licence (ACL) &ndash; the number will be listed on their website. It&rsquo;s a legal requirement for lenders to have an ACL and this is added protection for you, the consumer. If you have borrowed money from a business with an ACL you will have greater legal protection when it comes to resolving any disputes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In terms of worries about online hackers or identity theft, financial institutions are always improving the security of their sites and using increasingly complex encoding and encryption software to protect their customers and themselves. It is worth speaking to the individual lender of your choice to find out what security mechanisms they have in place.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the rewards and risks?</strong></h3>\n<p>Customer service online and via the telephone is generally highly thought of because you are communicating with qualified credit professionals rather than call centre staff. This means an informed individual is there to give you advice and help you to structure a home loan that meets your needs. Often you are in a position to borrow more from an online lender, as they will assess your financial performance based on personal information rather than a computer algorithm. While banks focus on the total amount of credit available to you via credit cards, for example, online assessors will look at your actual balances.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not comfortable communicating online and by phone then online banking is probably not for you.</p>",,590,0,3,9,259,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,86.7,232.0

Why build for yourself? You probably want to create a home style that will match your lifestyle, reflecting your character and values as well as your environment. It's a worthy ambition to create an original home and is one that owner builder loans can help you realise.</p>\n<h2>What are owner builder loans?</h2>\n<p>When you're planning to build your own home, it's highly likely you will need financial help, and possible lenders will look at your project to see if they want to support it. Owner builder loans are available to assist you to pay the cost of building a property but they are sometimes tricky to obtain. You will usually take out a loan over a short time period &ndash; it's usually around a year &ndash; so that you have sufficient time to get the home built. When the building is completed, you'll need to pay off the owner builder loan. It means that you'll have to refinance with a new loan, generally called an ""end loan"", and you can do this by taking out a standard mortgage over a number of years. Depending on what lenders are offering - and you should do plenty of research - you could get a variable mortgage or one with a fixed rate for a specified number of years.</p>\n<h2>How do owner builder loans compare to similar products?</h2>\n<p>These types of loan may be more expensive than an ordinary mortgage because the lender is taking a risk in that there is only an idea, not an actual tangible asset that can be easily valued. If your builder doesn't deliver to the standard expected, then your lender's investment could be devalued. If you are seeking this type of loan, you need to ensure that potential lenders can be confident that they are making a good investment.</p>\n<h2>Are there specific features that you need to think about for an owner builder loan?</h2>\n<p>You need to provide potential lenders with solid, reliable information about your building projects. You need a reputable building firm and detailed plans to be submitted as well as a realistic timetable. Be aware that building projects often overrun in terms of time and cost, so factor in some contingency when you take out a loan. You'll only pay interest on the money drawn down by the builder in most cases, so keep a close eye on what is happening on-site and what money for the loan is going out. If you have an architect, it will be their job to monitor the development. It will cost you, but sometimes it's worth having a professional available, especially if you have busy work and social schedules.</p>\n<h2>Is it risky?</h2>\n<p>There are risks associated with these loans, but risks within your control can be mitigated. Some risks, for example a contractor going bankrupt, cannot be controlled by you. Keep your project on track, and especially on time, and at the end, you may have had a few upsets but you will emerge with the home of your dreams.</p>",,170,74,467,468,6280,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,822.25,112.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h2>Owner occupied loans</h2>\n<p>Getting a loan if you are going to be an owner-occupier can be easier than getting other types of loan. That's because if the property you occupy is your main residence, the place you call ""home"", mortgage lenders consider that it will be looked after better than if you rent it out. They also know that should you default they could sell the property and recover their money.</p>\n<h2>What is an owner occupied home?</h2>\n<p>The term ""owner occupied"" relates to a property that you use primarily for yourself. When you seek to buy such a property, a mortgage lender may give you a more favourable loan interest rate. The lender could also offer better lending terms because they believe that an owner-occupier is a safer bet in terms of wear and tear on the property. If you want a loan for a primary residence but don't plan to live there, it is likely that many mortgage lenders will be unwilling to give you a loan. There might be specific terms and conditions attached to an owner-occupier loan that may prevent you from renting the property out, at least for a period of time. Always check those terms and conditions carefully.</p>\n<h2>What are the requirements for owner-occupied loans?</h2>\n<p>It's not always the case, but most lenders will loan on the condition that you don't rent out what they consider to be your primary residence. Mortgage rules vary from company to company, so finding out what a lender will or will not allow is essential when you're searching for loans. A lender that may allow you to rent out your property may also charge you a higher interest rate. Do your mortgage loan calculations carefully, and search the market to see if some companies are offering special deals for a period with a fixed interest rate. You could save yourself a considerable amount of money, and a fixed rate means that you can plan your finances knowing that for a certain amount of time, you won't get an increase in your monthly payment. Remember that if interest rates go down during this period, you won't benefit from a reduction in your payments.</p>\n<h2>How do you get lender permission?</h2>\n<p>The best approach is to be upfront with your lender about what you plan to do. If you do plan to let out what the mortgage holder considers to be your main residence, communicate your ideas and check the small print to see if you can do this. It's not uncommon to rent out a property, but if you have a loan on it, your lender will want to be certain that scheduled repayments will continue.</p>\n<h2>Can you get another mortgage?</h2>\n<p>There's no reason why not, but your mortgage lender may or may not consider your rented out property as income for qualification for a new mortgage. You'll need to prove that you can afford two mortgages.</p>\n<p>When looking for an owner occupied loan, do some thorough research as to the options available before you make a final decision.</p>",,5,59,459,487,11282,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1300.1,88.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong>Home loans in Perth</strong></h1>\n<p>Mainly a city based on mining, Western Australia&rsquo;s capital, Perth, is located in the south west of the state. Most of the city&rsquo;s population live along the coast and near the Swan River. In addition to being a popular tourist destination, Perth&rsquo;s economy is driven by the service and resources sector with the majority of residents working in state and council employment centred in the city. Perth&rsquo;s property market prices vary due to external national and international economic factors. The property and <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan</a> sector is regulated by the federal and Western Australian governments.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Perth&rsquo;s housing market and economy like?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The city&rsquo;s property market and economy is heavily reliant on its core industries, traditionally being mining and, in recent years, service roles. Employment and the property market can tend to fluctuate with these industries. Therefore, a change of government or a drop or increase in commodity prices can have a large impact on the city.</p>\n<p>Due to the mining downturn in recent years the Perth economy has declined slightly, with residents, business leaders and politicians looking for new industries to fill the void of the resources and mining sector. As you can imagine, due to lessening demand and decreasing employment and income levels, property prices have fallen. This is expected to improve over the long-term.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>How does Perth differ from other capital cities in Australia?</strong></h2>\n<p>Due to its size and distance from other main metropolitan centres, Perth sees less demand for property than Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. It also has more land available for residential and industrial developments and is not suffering from a housing shortage. Similarly, house prices are on average lower than those in comparable cities. Due to its vulnerability to external economic factors, Perth&rsquo;s economy and property market tends to fluctuate more than Sydney&rsquo;s and Melbourne&rsquo;s, with the larger cities experiencing steady demand despite the state of the national and international economy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why should I consider getting a home loan in Perth?</strong></h2>\n<p>Perth&rsquo;s property market is extremely affordable if you are looking to live in a capital city. You will also find - compared to Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney - properties in popular locations, such as overlooking the river or close to the CBD will be cheaper. Also, being less densely populated, Perth is generally more lifestyle friendly with more parking spaces and less traffic congestion. The <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">home loan</a> market is similar to those of other capital cities with comparable - if not the same - regulations and requirements for getting a home loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What potential problems will I face?</strong></h2>\n<p>Perth is a boom and bust economy closely aligned with the commodities sector. As such, you could have difficulty selling during a downturn.</p>\n<p>If you have stable employment, Perth&rsquo;s property market is a buyers&rsquo; market with relatively affordable housing options. Perth&rsquo;s climate is also milder than other capital cities and it suffers less extreme weather events. However, being on the coast, flooding and high levels of rainfall can occur and there is a risk of major fire events.</p>\n<p>You should expect to pay similar fees and charges, such as stamp duty, land taxes and rates, as other cities in Australia. Perth has a strong connection to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people so depending on the type of property you are considering purchasing, you will need to research native title laws and regulations.</p>",,260,13,82,70,4333,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,488.6,142.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong><span>Portability home loans</span></strong></h1>\n<p>When you move home you don&rsquo;t always need to refinance. Instead, if you are happy with the terms and your new property meets the conditions set by your lender, you can take your existing home loan with you. Nowadays many&nbsp;standard home loans offer the opportunity to do this so you can save yourself the hassle of exiting one loan arrangement and setting up another.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why opt for portable home loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Portability equals flexibility when it comes to home loans, and as standard loans are often taken out for between 25 to 30 years it&rsquo;s quite likely you&rsquo;ll want to move house once or twice during the loan term. <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/portabilty"">Portability home loans</a></span> mean you only have to pay upfront costs once, rather than each time you move. Lenders set different parameters and have different rules when it comes to who is eligible to use the portability feature so it&rsquo;s important to check these when you first take out your home loan rather than risk disappointment when you decide you want to move.</p>\n<p>You should also be aware of the following factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will need to provide evidence to demonstrate that you&rsquo;re moving house, such as the contracts of purchase and sale relating to both your new and your old properties respectively;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be issued with new mortgage documents and your valuation documents must comply with your lender&rsquo;s loan to value (LVR) ratio;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>It may be possible to top up your existing loan and to agree with your lender whether exchange and settlement must occur on the same day; some obliging lenders will vary this rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the rewards?</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the chief benefits of portability home loans is that they help you save money in two ways. When you first apply for a loan you have to pay establishment fees and these can be hefty, depending on your lender. With home loan portability, you will simply be transferring your existing loan to a new property so there will be no need to pay repeat fees. In just the same way, when you leave a loan or repay it early you will normally have to pay discharge&nbsp;fees. These can vary according to the lender and may be costly. With portability home loans, you simply transfer your loan to the new house so you don&rsquo;t have to pay those fees twice.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the risks?</strong></h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are some restrictions on portability home loans that you need to consider carefully before committing to one. While you can certainly save time and money, you may not be able to alter the loan structure, including how many borrowers are liable for repayments and the level of the agreed interest rate. You may have to sign a variation if the amount you are borrowing is going to change.</p>\n<p>The other risk is that despite saving on some fees your lender may charge you a fee to transfer your loan. On the positive side, this is normally a modest amount even if you still owe a large amount of money from the original loan.</p>",,5,0,0,1,62,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,6.8500000000000005,398.0

If you're already an owner-occupier, you could have equity in your home that will mean a profit when you sell it, paying off the principal loan but leaving you enough money to put down a deposit for another property. If you're looking to get onto the first rung of the housing ladder you'll need a deposit that could be quite substantial. The deposit percentage of the sale price will depend on which lender you choose, so it's worth shopping around to get a deal that suits your financial situation.</p>\n<h2>What are principal and interest loans?</h2>\n<p>When you take out a loan for a property, you receive a lump sum to buy it. This goes to the seller, who will pick up the costs of the estate agent and their solicitor, whereas you will have to pick up the costs of a surveyor and your own solicitor. You could consider asking a lender to add these costs into the overall loan if you are a little short of ready money because you've put down a deposit. Remember, you will be charged interest on paying those fees as well as for the principal loan.</p>\n<h2>How do principal and interest loans compare to other similar products?</h2>\n<p>Buying a house is probably going to be the biggest purchase you will make in your lifetime, however many times you do it, and mortgage companies work to offer you better rates than if you went to a bank or tried to take out a large loan from somewhere else that would charge much higher rates. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't talk to banks &ndash; it's you who will decide on what the best and most affordable offer is. Finance companies want your business, so take the time to explore offers and deals.</p>\n<h2>How do repayments work for loans?</h2>\n<p>Most home loan repayments are made up of a mix of paying interest on the principal loan and making a contribution to paying off that principal. At the end of the loan term, you will be the owner of the property outright. The loan could take many years to pay off, which is what you would expect, but it depends on your circumstances and what stage you're at on the property ladder. You can choose a variable interest rate, where your payments could increase or decrease according to interest rate movements, or a fixed rate where you know exactly what you pay every month. You could also choose to split between fixed and variable &ndash; a split rate. Interest only repayments may be offered, but you won't pay anything off the principal loan with this, so you need to consider how you will repay that at the end.</p>\n<h2>What are the risks and rewards involved?</h2>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you fail to keep up payments, your home could be repossessed; however, if you make your mortgage payments as you should you will eventually be the proud owner of a property worth much more than you originally paid for it.</p>",,390,14,44,63,4420,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,504.05,141.0

The population is mostly centred in the southeast corner, with the major cities of Brisbane and Gold Coast being a hub for employment, culture and government. The cities of Townsville, Cairns and Rockhampton are also popular centres along the North Queensland coastline. These areas are extremely appealing to both interstate and foreign buyers due to employment opportunities and the exceptionally good lifestyle.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>What do I need to know about the Queensland property market and economy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The cities and towns further east and along the coastline rely on tourism for a large part of their income, with the lovely beaches, the Great Barrier Reef and other natural features being a drawcard for tourists. The further you go west into the more arid rural areas, both the agricultural and mining industries become more prominent and economically lucrative. Properties towards the southeast coast and parts of the northern coast are generally in higher demand and can be more expensive than similar properties in other parts of the state and interstate. Conversely, properties towards the west of the state are more affordable but employment opportunities vary depending on the current success or otherwise of the agricultural and mining industries.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Should I get a home loan in Queensland?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Queensland economy and property market is usually stable and at times experiences positive growth. Due to the state&rsquo;s attractive natural features, properties are usually in high demand and are a good investment. The state also has a relatively low or average cost of living compared to Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. All <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">home loans</a> are regulated under the Commonwealth government laws and regulations.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2><img style=""width: 100%;"" class="""" alt=""The 74 Whitsunday Islands lie between the northeast coast of Queensland, Australia, and the Great Barrier Reef, a massive stretch of coral teeming with marine life.

Natural fires also occur. Certain suburbs, towns and properties are more vulnerable than others to these conditions. It is important to research this before purchasing a property in Queensland.</p>\n<h2><strong>Does the Queensland Government charge extra fees or levies?</strong></h2>\n<p>Like other states, the Queensland Government charges a transfer duty when purchasing a property. It is <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">calculated</a> on the value of the property or the consideration paid - whichever is greatest. There is usually an additional amount charged if a foreigner is purchasing residential land. Also, depending on the type and intended use of the property you are purchasing, you may have to pay a landholder duty.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Can I apply for any concessions or grants?</strong></h2>\n<p>The government offers a First Home Owners&rsquo; Grant if you are a first home buyer and are buying or building a new property. You may also be eligible for a housing finance loan provided by the government for the purchase of an established house, unit, townhouse or duplex, or to build a new house. These programs have a number of conditions and are subject to change.</p>",,40,19,139,109,3713,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,422.0,153.0

To do it, you&rsquo;ll need to research <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/refinance-rates"">home loan refinance rates</a> to find a loan that offers a lower rate than your current one, providing enough of a saving to compensate for the costs involved. This will mean checking out what&rsquo;s on offer just as you did when you first took out your loan &ndash; but with a few extra considerations.</p>\n<h3><strong>Switch or stay?</strong></h3>\n<p>Refinancing your loan could mean switching to a new lender or staying with the existing, but moving to another loan they are selling, with better rates. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. If you&rsquo;re dissatisfied with your current lender, switching could be a relief, but it does mean having to persuade someone new to accept you and get used to how they do things. You may be able to take advantage of a low introductory rate. On the other hand, you may want to maintain a good relationship with your current lender, and discharge&nbsp;fees are sometimes waived if you&rsquo;re simply moving to a new product with them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Home loan refinancing interest rates</strong></h3>\n<p>Refinancing works just the same way as getting a new loan, so you will need to look at the interest rates on offer. Remember that using the comparison rate makes it easy to factor in fees as well and reduces the risk of being caught out by hidden costs. You should also remember that the total amount you will pay in interest also depends on the loan term.</p>\n<h3><strong>Is it the right time to refinance?</strong></h3>\n<p>Most people refinance for one of two reasons. Either their circumstances have changed &ndash; for instance, you might now be in a position to pay off your loan more quickly &ndash; or they have been on a fixed rate loan and the national interest rate has fallen considerably, so much better deals have become available. Usually you will not be allowed to finance until you are at least two years into the loan term.</p>\n<h3><strong>Costs of refinancing</strong></h3>\n<p>Most people on fixed rate loans and some people on variable rate loans will have charges to pay if they decide to end the agreement with their lenders early. There can also be costs involved in obtaining the documentation needed to determine whether or not you qualify for the new arrangement you want, and of course you should factor in the cost of your time, as there can be quite a bit of paperwork and negotiation to do.</p>\n<h3><strong>Main considerations</strong></h3>\n<p>Although some people are forced to refinance because they can no longer afford their existing monthly payments, most people do so voluntarily. Some borrowers&nbsp;wait for a time when the Reserve Bank&nbsp;interest rate is low and when you can find a deal that meets your requirements. Run through the numbers carefully to be sure of what you can afford, and remember that you could lose money in charges if you can&rsquo;t commit to your new loan for the agreed length of time.</p>\n<h3><strong>Pros and cons</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pay interest at a lower rate;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pay off your loan sooner;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>May involve paying discharge and upfront fees.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",,2000,3,22,26,672,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,275.9,167.0

In essence, they refer to the process of switching home loans for the purpose of saving money, increasing flexibility, adding to the loan amount or consolidating debts.</p>\n<p>Refinancing has become particularly popular in a low interest rate world because the variance between high interest rate lenders and low interest rate lenders is significant, according to RateCity data. What does this mean? Say a borrower had a $600,000 home loan with a rate of 4.5 per cent over 30 years. If they refinanced to a 3.9 per cent rate, they would stand to save $210 a month. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are some of the reasons refinancing is popular among borrowers:&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The reasons borrowers refinance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To reduce their loan costs</strong> &ndash; Refinancing saves some&nbsp;borrowers money&nbsp;on a monthly basis, but also over the life of a loan. The actual amount saved will depend on a number of variables, including the size of the loan, the rate discount and any ongoing and administration fees. If your goal is to reduce your monthly repayments you can user RateCity mortgage repayment calculator to see how much you could save by refinancing every month.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To increase flexibility or features &ndash; </strong>When you first applied for your home loan, you may have been driven other factors than those that drive you now. Perhaps you were in a lower paying job or a job that paid you monthly or maybe you have since come into an inheritance. If you were simply looking for the lowest rate at the time, you may have missed out on a number of popular features lenders now provide, including offset accounts, redraw facilities and the ability to make extra repayments. If you can afford to pay down your loan quicker, then these functions may save you over the longer term.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To free up some equity</strong> &ndash; If you&rsquo;ve paid off a chunk of your home loan, you may be eligible to extend your borrowing amount with a line of credit. The benefit here is that you could be paying a lower amount of interest via your home loan than you would if you had a credit card. Taking on additional debt always carries risks though, so before you go down this path, be sure to speak to a professional, such as a financial adviser, about the pros and cons for your personal situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To consolidate debts &ndash; </strong>Some borrowers have multiple streams of debt. They may have multiple housing loans, personal loans and credit card debt. By syphoning those debts into the one account, they may be in a position to save, depending on the level of debt they have.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To find a lender that treats them better</strong> &ndash; It&rsquo;s not unusual for borrowers to claim they&rsquo;ve felt neglected by their lender. Perhaps that means not getting a call back when they request it, poor customer service at a branch, poor notification of changes or not passing on interest rate reductions. Feeling disenchanted with a lender is a common reason for refinancing for many Australians. It&rsquo;s important to make sure before you switch loans that your new lender is an improvement on the old one. For many that means making sure communication is strong and interest rates and fees remain low.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To take advantage of incentives &ndash; </strong>From time to time, lenders offer incentives to try and hook new borrowers. These incentives can be quite generous and range from cashback offers, to holidays, to new cars. Before you refinance to take advantage of an incentive, it&rsquo;s important to look at the fine print and make sure the interest rate and fees for the new loan are reasonable and aligned to your financial goals. It&rsquo;s worth using a repayment calculator to determine how much more you&rsquo;ll pay monthly, yearly and over the life of the loan, if your interest rate is higher than your current rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The reasons borrowers don&rsquo;t refinance</h3>\n<div style=""width: 100% , height:100%;""><iframe style=""width: 100%; min-height: 450px;"" src=""//embed.chartblocks.com/1.0/?c=583cddef9973d2144692177b&t=b1150d932e51c53""></iframe></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The time/effort involved</strong> &ndash; The main reason people don&rsquo;t refinance is because they can&rsquo;t be bothered, due to the perceived effort for the amount they&rsquo;ll save. A RateCity survey found almost 40 per cent of borrowers cite this as a barrier. In reality refinance does not require much of the borrower and in sum cases can be completed in 3 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>Refinance process</h6>\n<h3>Time & effort involved in refinancing</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/mortgage-news/long-take-refinance"">Learn More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The chance the new lender will be worse than the old one</strong> &ndash; Any change is a risk and for almost a quarter of borrowers, the risk the new lender won&rsquo;t be any better is enough of a reason for them to stay put.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The hassle of unlinking bundled products</strong> &ndash; For those who have several bank products, including credit cards, transaction accounts and term deposits, linked to the one lender, it can be a daunting task to either switch them all over to the new lender or to set up a new direct debit to your mortgage. However, many smaller lenders recognise this and have upped the ante on their customer service for bundled products. It can be as simple as filling out one form with your new lender and getting them to take care of a lot of the heavy lifting. It&rsquo;s worth checking before you sign up to any new loan what sort of customer service the lender provides and how they handle mortgage transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The associated costs</strong> &ndash; Surveyed home owners cited the switching costs as one of their major deterrents to moving lenders. Their rationale is that the cost of moving would outweigh the benefits they receive. However, in many cases, that&rsquo;s not correct. &lsquo;Exit costs&rsquo; were banned in 2011, which means borrowers now only have to worry about a discharge fee and the upfront fee of their new loan. While discharge fees tend to hover around the $200-$300 mark, the average upfront costs from RateCity&rsquo;s database of loans is $396. However there are more than 1200 loans on RateCity.com.au with no upfront fees at all.</li>\n<ul></ul>\n</ul>\n<h3>How much does it cost to refinance?</h3>\n<p>The costs you may encounter when refinancing are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discharge fees (average: $250) &ndash; When you terminate your loan, you will likely have to pay a discharge fee to cover the paperwork your old lender has to compile.</li>\n<li>Upfront costs (average: $400) &ndash; these include establishment fees, valuation and settlement costs.</li>\n<li>Break fees - if your current home loan is on a fixed rate you should contact your lender first and find out the break fee associated with switching.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When considering the so-called switch cost, it is important to examine it with respect to the savings. A common question many borrowers ask is:&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>""How long will it take me to return the switch cost and what will be my total saving in the first year?""</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>Break even calculation</h6>\n<h3>How long will it take me to cover the switch cost</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://ratecity.com.au/home-loans/articles/long-take-break-even-refinancing"">Learn More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-tip"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">TIP</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>Some&nbsp;lenders will cover your discharge cost and forfeit the up front cost to earn your business.

Make contact with your new prospective lender (Estimate: 30 mins to 1 hour)</strong></p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen the new loan you wish to move to, it&rsquo;s time to make contact with the lender to discuss your desires and suitability. Most lenders can be contacted by phone or through the chat function on their site, where they will often request to call you at a convenient time. In your consultation, they will ask you about your reasons for refinancing, your property, your loan amount, your equity, your suburb, your employment details and potentially your future plans for the property. The reason they ask these questions is to ascertain whether you&rsquo;re a suitable candidate from their perspective for finance.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important at this stage to confirm how your lender deals with employment loss, default and whether they offer repayment holidays. It&rsquo;s also a good time to talk about fees you will be charged at the onset and termination of the loan, as well as any ongoing charges.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Start the application process (Your time commitment estimate: 1 hour- 8 hours depending on personal finance situation)</strong></p>\n<p>If your new prospective lender has deemed you a suitable candidate and you&rsquo;ve deemed them a suitable lender, you can proceed to the next stage of preparing your paperwork. The documents you will need include, but may not be limited to: identification details, your past loan statements, employment letters and pay slips. Some lenders require this paperwork to be delivered in person and sighted by a Justice of the Peace, others accept documents scanned online, others accept documents by post. Confirm their desired methods and then send them off.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Get your valuation (Your time commitment estimate: 1- 3 hours to find a suitable time and minimal property preparations)</strong></p>\n<p>One of the last suitability checks your lender will require is a valuation of your property. This is primarily done to ensure you have enough equity to secure the loan. Sometimes lenders will also want to ensure your geographical region is increasing in value in case they have to repossess and sell your property. Essentially they want to know they can recoup their investment.</p>\n<p>How the property will actually be valued varies by lender. Some lenders will want someone to look inside, others will be comfortable driving by, others can do the evaluation remotely. It&rsquo;s worth noting many borrowers get their first valuation free, but that&rsquo;s usually redeemed when you first settle. You will likely be charged a valuation fee when you refinance, which is usually between $100 and $400.</p>\n<p>If the valuation determines you have less than 20 per cent equity, you may be required to pay lenders&rsquo; mortgage insurance on your new loan.</p>\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Receive your approval or rejection from lender (Your time commitment estimate: N/A)</strong></p>\n<p>Within a few hours to a few days, your prospective lender will be in touch to let you know the status of your application. If you are approved, you proceed to the next stage of transferring the title from the old lender to the new lender.</p>\n<p>If you are rejected, it&rsquo;s worth getting back in touch with the lender to see what happens next. If you have been rejected because you do not have enough equity in your property, you may be able to pay additional insurance to secure the loan or secure it against a different type of equity. Some lenders also have valuation appeal processes.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Transfer your loan (Your time commitment estimate: 30 mins to 1 hour)</strong></p>\n<p>After your loan has been approved, you will need to sign some discharge paperwork and then your existing mortgage is transferred to your new lender. This process can take up to two weeks. At this stage, you may pay a discharge fee.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Settlement of your new loan (Your time commitment estimate: 30 mins to 1 hour)</strong></p>\n<p>Your final stage of refinancing, the settlement involves paying your upfront fees and setting up your mortgage direct debits.</p>\n<p><em>NOTE: Your time commitment estimate is how long our survey results indicate how many hours of your time will be taken up with each stage. It does not include wait times you may incur as your lender assesses your application. &nbsp;</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-example"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">What do I need to refinance?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>- Past loan statements;</p>\n<p>- Employment details & payslips;</p>\n<p>- Identification details- passport, driver's licence.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>The process of switching mortgages</h2>\n<p>The precise process and timeline you will follow when you switch loans varies depending on the lender you choose, your past lender, the ease of your valuation and how readily available your documentation and personal finances are.

Some surveyed RateCity users have refinanced up to three times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, if you refinance several times, it could impair your credit score. Lenders assess your credit score when you apply for new loans, so if you damage it, you may not be able to refinance if and when you really need to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before refinancing multiple times, you should get a copy of your credit report and ensure it&rsquo;s in good shape for future refinances.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=""css-accordion-panel"" id=""acc13"">\n<h2><a href=""#acc13"">I have a poor credit rating.

However, you may pay a slightly higher interest rate, higher fees or lenders&rsquo; mortgage insurance. When you take out a home loan, the lender wants a high level of probability that you will repay the loan. Reviewing your credit score is one of the key ways they ascertain that level of probability.

Here's everything&nbsp;you need to know</span></h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a home loan, you may have come across the terms &lsquo;refinancing&rsquo; or &lsquo;re-mortgaging&rsquo;. In essence, they refer to the process of switching home loans for the purpose of saving money, increasing flexibility, adding to the loan amount or consolidating debts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Refinancing has become particularly popular in a low interest rate world because the variance between high interest rate lenders and low interest rate lenders is significant, according to RateCity data. What does this mean? Say a borrower had a $600,000 home loan with a rate of 4.5 per cent over 30 years. If they refinanced to a 3.9 per cent rate, they would stand to save $210 a month. &nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img style=""width: 100%;"" class="""" alt="""" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161125103152/iStock_67001977_XXXLARGE-compressor2.jpg"" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The reasons borrowers refinance</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To reduce their loan costs</strong> &ndash; As the below example demonstrates, refinancing can save borrowers a huge amount of money on a monthly basis, but also over the life of a loan. The actual amount saved will depend on a number of variables, including the size of the loan, the rate discount and any ongoing and administration fees. RateCity analysis of historical <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/mortgage-rates"">home loan rates</a> found a borrower with a $350,000 could have saved as much as $16,000 over a ten-year period by switching to a low cost lender.

Perhaps you were in a lower paying job or a job that paid you monthly or maybe you have since come into an inheritance. If you were simply looking for the lowest rate at the time, you may have missed out on a number of popular features lenders now provide, including offset accounts, redraw facilities and the ability to make extra repayments. If you can afford to pay down your loan quicker, then these functions may save you over the longer term.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=""embed-container""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sd8V6SoTvrE""></iframe></div>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To free up some equity</strong> &ndash; If you&rsquo;ve paid off a chunk of your home loan, you may be eligible to extend your borrowing amount with a line of credit. The benefit here is that you could be paying a lower amount of interest via your home loan than you would if you had a credit card. Taking on additional debt always carries risks though, so before you go down this path, be sure to speak to a professional, such as a financial adviser, about the pros and cons for your personal situation.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To consolidate debts &ndash; </strong>Some borrowers have multiple streams of debt. They may have multiple housing loans, personal loans and credit card debt. By syphoning those debts into the one account, they may be in a position to save, depending on the level of debt they have.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To take advantage of incentives &ndash; </strong>From time to time, lenders offer incentives to try and hook new borrowers. These incentives can be quite generous and range from cashback offers, to holidays, to new cars. Before you refinance to take advantage of an incentive, it&rsquo;s important to look at the fine print and make sure the interest rate and fees for the new loan are reasonable and aligned to your financial goals. It&rsquo;s worth using a repayment calculator to determine how much more you&rsquo;ll pay monthly, yearly and over the life of the loan, if your interest rate is higher than your current rate.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To find a lender that treats them better</strong> &ndash; It&rsquo;s not unusual for borrowers to claim they&rsquo;ve felt neglected by their lender. Perhaps that means not getting a call back when they request it, poor customer service at a branch, poor notification of changes or not passing on interest rate reductions. Feeling disenchanted with a lender is a common reason for refinancing for many Australians. It&rsquo;s important to make sure before you switch loans that your new lender is an improvement on the old one. For many that means making sure communication is strong and interest rates and fees remain low.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-tip""><br />\n<div class=""breakout-heading""><br />\n<p class=""breakout-title""><strong>CASE STUDY -&nbsp;Mark chose a new bank and saved almost $9000</strong></p>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=""breakout-body""><br />\n<p>Mark* opened his first bank account when he was six years old, so naturally when it became time to get a home loan when he was 32, he didn&rsquo;t think twice about banking with the lender he knew.

A RateCity survey found almost 40 per cent of borrowers cite this as a barrier.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The chance the new lender will be worse than the old one</strong> &ndash; Any change is a risk and for almost a quarter of borrowers, the risk the new lender won&rsquo;t be any better is enough of a reason for them to stay put.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The hassle of unlinking bundled products</strong> &ndash; For those who have several bank products, including credit cards, transaction accounts and term deposits, linked to the one lender, it can be a daunting task to either switch them all over to the new lender or to set up a new direct debit to your mortgage. However, many smaller lenders recognise this and have upped the ante on their customer service for bundled products. It can be as simple as filling out one form with your new lender and getting them to take care of a lot of the heavy lifting. It&rsquo;s worth checking before you sign up to any new loan what sort of customer service the lender provides and how they handle mortgage transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The associated costs</strong> &ndash; Surveyed home owners cited the switching costs as one of their major deterrents to moving lenders. Their rationale is that the cost of moving would outweigh the benefits they receive. However, in many cases, that&rsquo;s not correct. &lsquo;Exit costs&rsquo; were banned in 2011, which means borrowers now only have to worry about a discharge fee and the upfront fee of their new loan. While discharge fees tend to hover around the $200-$300 mark, the average upfront costs from RateCity&rsquo;s database of loans is $396. However there are more than 1200 loans on RateCity.com.au with no upfront fees at all.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How much does it cost to refinance?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The costs you may encounter when refinancing are as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Discharge fees (average: $250) &ndash; when you terminate your loan, you will likely have to pay a discharge fee to cover the paperwork your old lender has to compile.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Upfront costs (average: $400) &ndash; these include establishment fees, valuation and settlement costs.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Lenders&rsquo; mortgage insurance &ndash; LMI is usually only applicable to borrowers with a loan to valuation ratio above 80 per cent. How much lenders with smaller deposits will have to pay depends on the size of their loan relative to how much they can contribute upfront. Your prospective lender will tell you if LMI&nbsp;is applicable.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Calculate your break even point based on your refinancing goal</h2>\n<p></p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-example""><br />\n<div class=""breakout-heading""><br />\n<p class=""breakout-title"">REDUCE MONTHLY REPAYMENTS</p>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=""breakout-body""><br />\n<p>As an example lets say your current mortgage is <strong>$600,000</strong> on a <strong>5 per cent</strong>&nbsp;interest rate and you are left with <strong>20 years</strong> of repayments.

However, it should follow a similar format to this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-59947"" alt=""refinancingprocess-infographic-v22"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161201124152/RefinancingProcess-Infographic-v222-659x1024.jpg"" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1.&nbsp;Choose your loan (Estimate: 15 mins &ndash; 1 hour)</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve committed to the refinancing process, use RateCity.com.au to locate your ideal loan based on your personal set of criteria.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Make contact with your new prospective lender (Estimate: 30 mins to 1 hour)</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen the new loan you wish to move to, it&rsquo;s time to make contact with the lender to discuss your desires and suitability. Most lenders can be contacted by phone or through the chat function on their site, where they will often request to call you at a convenient time. In your consultation, they will ask you about your reasons for refinancing, your property, your loan amount, your equity, your suburb, your employment details and potentially your future plans for the property. The reason they ask these questions is to ascertain whether you&rsquo;re a suitable candidate from their perspective for finance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important at this stage to confirm how your lender deals with employment loss, default and whether they offer repayment holidays. It&rsquo;s also a good time to talk about fees you will be charged at the onset and termination of the loan, as well as any ongoing charges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. Start the application process (Your time commitment estimate: 1 hour- 8 hours depending on personal finance situation)</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>If your new prospective lender has deemed you a suitable candidate and you&rsquo;ve deemed them a suitable lender, you can proceed to the next stage of preparing your paperwork. The documents you will need include, but may not be limited to: identification details, your past loan statements, employment letters and pay slips. Some lenders require this paperwork to be delivered in person and sighted by a Justice of the Peace, others accept documents scanned online, others accept documents by post. Confirm their desired methods and then send them off.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. Get your valuation (Your time commitment estimate: 1- 3 hours to find a suitable time and minimal property preparations)</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the last suitability checks your lender will require is a valuation of your property. This is primarily done to ensure you have enough equity to secure the loan. Sometimes lenders will also want to ensure your geographical region is increasing in value in case they have to repossess and sell your property. Essentially they want to know they can recoup their investment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How the property will actually be valued varies by lender. Some lenders will want someone to look inside, others will be comfortable driving by, others can do the evaluation remotely. It&rsquo;s worth noting many borrowers get their first valuation free, but that&rsquo;s usually redeemed when you first settle. You will likely be charged a valuation fee when you refinance, which is usually between $100 and $400.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If the valuation determines you have less than 20 per cent equity, you may be required to pay lenders&rsquo; mortgage insurance on your new loan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>5.&nbsp;Receive your approval or rejection from lender (Your time commitment estimate: N/A)</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Within a few hours to a few days, your prospective lender will be in touch to let you know the status of your application. If you are approved, you proceed to the next stage of transferring the title from the old lender to the new lender.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you are rejected, it&rsquo;s worth getting back in touch with the lender to see what happens next. If you have been rejected because you do not have enough equity in your property, you may be able to pay additional insurance to secure the loan or secure it against a different type of equity. Some lenders also have valuation appeal processes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>6. Transfer your loan (Your time commitment estimate: 30 mins to 1 hour)</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>After your loan has been approved, you will need to sign some discharge paperwork and then your existing mortgage is transferred to your new lender. This process can take up to two weeks. At this stage, you may pay a discharge fee.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>7. Settlement of your new loan (Your time commitment estimate: 30 mins to 1 hour)</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your final stage of refinancing, the settlement involves paying your upfront fees and setting up your mortgage direct debits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>NOTE: Your time commitment estimate is how long our survey results indicate how many hours of your time will be taken up with each stage.

Therefore, they were both concerned when they realised their lender had only passed on half of the recent two RBA interest rate cuts. They knew had their lender passed on the full rate cuts, they would have been better off by about $177 a month on a $600,000 mortgage. However, for Sarah and James, it was a question of time versus money. They each work 50 hours a week and spend their weekends building their small business. In Sarah&rsquo;s opinion, it didn&rsquo;t make sense to sacrifice revenue from their side business for what could be a commensurate saving. James got in touch with a mortgage broker and discovered the process could be streamlined and he and Sarah would only have to provide two documents and sign two forms, while still saving about $100 a month based on the loans they qualified for. They went with the broker path.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-tip""><br />\n<div class=""breakout-heading""><br />\n<p class=""breakout-title"">CASE STUDY &ndash; Josie&rsquo;s application is declined</p>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=""breakout-body""><br />\n<p>Josie* bought her first apartment in Sydney&rsquo;s Western Suburbs in 2014 after securing a good deal from a mortgage broker. Her apartment was valued at $220,000 at the time of purchase and she was able to come up with a deposit of $11,000 for an owner-occupier loan. Earlier this year, Josie started to look for ways to reduce her mortgage payments and realised her interest rate of 5.25 per cent was well above the market average. She saw another lender was offering owner-occupier home loans for 3.4 per cent. The new loan would save her more than $200 a month.</p>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<br />\n<p>Josie met with the new lender about the loan and provided the relevant documentation. Given that she lives in a high density area, her new lender required an onsite valuation, where they assessed the land size, the off-street parking and the number of bedrooms.</p>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<br />\n<p>Unfortunately, following the valuation, Josie&rsquo;s application was declined. Josie had not built enough equity in her property to ensure the lender could recoup their loan costs in the scenario there was market correction and the property needed to be repossessed and resold. The lender gave Josie the following options:</p>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<br />\n<p>1. Take out lenders&rsquo; mortgage insurance &ndash; given that Josie has less than 20 per cent equity and regulations have changed around loan to valuation ratios, the lender required further protection. For a few thousand dollars, Josie could elect to buy lenders&rsquo; mortgage insurance.</p>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<br />\n<p>2. Wait a little bit longer before refinancing to build up equity &ndash; even a couple of years could see Josie hit the LVR requirements.</p>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<br />\n<p>3. Dispute the valuation report &ndash; if Josie felt the valuation underestimated the property&rsquo;s value, she could request a second valuation, but this could see her pay a second fee. Ultimately, she chose to wait an extra two years before refinancing.</p>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<br />\n<p>*Name has been changed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Should you worry about smaller lenders?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A quick comparison will reveal some of Australia&rsquo;s smallest lenders have more competitive interest rates than the Big Four banks. Sometimes the disparity for comparable loans is up to a whole percentage point. One of the reasons small lenders are able to offer cheaper rates is because their overheads are lower; some of them are online only, some have limited branches and others have less staff than some of their big bank competitors.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For borrowers, this raises two questions. The first is &ndash; am I happy to sacrifice the customer service and branch access I may get from a larger bank for a cheaper rate? Ultimately that comes down to individual preference. Many borrowers would prefer to be able to step into a branch when they need to and are happy to pay a little more for the privilege.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second question is &ndash; can I trust a smaller lender?</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you&rsquo;re worried about whether smaller institutions have looser standards, the good news is small banks and building societies are bound by the Code of Banking Practice and Mutual Banking Code of Practice, which means they have the same rules around disclosing fees and charges and keeping your information secure.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If a smaller lender collapses, your home loan will be transferred to another lender.

It will vary on a case by case basis, which means before refinancing, prudent borrowers should ask their prospective lender for a cost estimate and use a refinancing calculator to calculate how long it would take to recoup those costs.</p>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=""css-accordion-panel"" id=""acc2""><br />\n<h2><a href=""#acc2"">How often should I refinance?<span class=""fa fa-plus""></span></a></h2>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The frequency of refinancing is a personal choice, based on a number of variables for every individual. As such, there is no ideal equation for whether a borrower should refinance and how often they should refinance.</span></p>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">RateCity data shows home owners with 30-year loan terms tend to refinance every four to five years on average.</span></p>\n<br />\n<div><br />\n<div class=""link-bar""><br />\n<div class=""col-sm-7""><br />\n<h6>Refinanced before?</h6>\n<br />\n<h3>How often should you switch?</h3>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/mortgage-news/how-often-should-you-refinance"">Find out now</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=""css-accordion-panel"" id=""acc3""><br />\n<h2><a href=""#acc3"">Does Australia have no cost refinancing?<span class=""fa fa-plus""></span></a></h2>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In your research on refinancing, you may have come across the term &lsquo;no cost refinancing&rsquo;. No cost refinancing sometimes occurs in the US and refers to a situation where the lender or the broker covers the associated costs, such as appraisal fees and settlement costs.</span></p>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately, in Australia, we don&rsquo;t really have no cost refinancing. The typical cost of refinancing is a few hundred dollars. However, it is still very popular, especially for borrowers with lengthy loan terms who can recoup those costs over a few months.</span></p>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=""css-accordion-panel"" id=""acc4""><br />\n<h2><a href=""#acc4"">Who should not refinance?<span class=""fa fa-plus""></span></a></h2>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Refinancing is certainly not for everyone; in fact for some borrowers, it will be not applicable or not appropriate.</span></p>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, the following cohorts would find little benefit in refinancing:</span></p>\n<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowers who are happy with their current rate, fees and level of debt;</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowers in the final year of their loan term &ndash; This is because the costs of refinancing could outweigh the financial benefit;</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowers with a small loan amount &ndash; The fees may be more than the actual loan;</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First home buyers &ndash; There is no reason to refinance when you&rsquo;re buying for the first time, but it is a good time to search for a good deal so you don&rsquo;t have to refinance.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<br /><br /></div>\n<br />\n<div class=""css-accordion-panel"" id=""acc5""><br />\n<h2><a href=""#acc5"">When is a good time to refinance?<span class=""fa fa-plus""></span></a></h2>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While there is no ideal time of year to refinance, reduced interest rates tend to follow a <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate"">Reserve Bank interest rate</a> cut.

After all, your current lender is making money from your business over a long period of time and should want to retain that.</span></p>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before you begin the refinancing process, it could be worth speaking to your current lender about whether they are offering flexibility on rates or fees. Lenders are well known to negotiate in order to keep customers. It&rsquo;s best to go into this process armed with information about comparable loans with low rates or fees and similar features to the ones you currently have.</span></p>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Read More:</span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/mortgage-news/negotiate-better-deal-three-tips-borrowers""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> How to negotiate a better deal</span></a></p>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=""css-accordion-panel"" id=""acc8""><br />\n<h2><a href=""#acc8"">Can I change jobs while I am refinancing my home loan?<span class=""fa fa-plus""></span></a></h2>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Given that the refinancing process can take up to a month from initial investigation to loan transfer, some borrowers could find it coincides with a recruitment process. If this is the case for you, you should definitely let your new lender know early in the application process. While it varies by lender, most lenders require refinancers to be in a permanent job with the same employer for at least 6 months before refinancing. Any interruption to this could reduce your chances of successfully completing the refinancing process.</span></p>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=""css-accordion-panel"" id=""acc9""><br />\n<h2><a href=""#acc9"">Can I refinance if I am on an employment contract?<span class=""fa fa-plus""></span></a></h2>\n<br />\n<p><span style=""font-weight:",0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.0,704.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p>A second mortgage is simply a home loan taken out on a property that is already mortgaged. This means you will have not one, but two home loans secured to your property. An arrangement such as this allows you to access additional funds; however, it is not regarded as a suitable financial solution for everyone.</p>\n<h3>When and why is a second mortgage needed?</h3>\n<p>If your existing lender has refused your request to borrow a larger loan amount so that you can access some of the equity in your home a second mortgage home loan could be a viable alternative. In addition, if you currently have a fixed rate home loan and you want to refinance you could be hit with expensive exit fees if you try to change provider, so taking out a second home loan may prove more helpful.</p>\n<p>Some parents have taken out a second mortgage when they wish to act as guarantors and use their home as security for a family member&rsquo;s home loan, or that of a friend. Having a second mortgage in this case also gives the bank additional security in the event that your family member or your friend, for some reason, default on their loan.</p>\n<h3>How do second mortgages work?</h3>\n<p>Unlike your first mortgage, your second mortgage works differently. It resembles having a line of credit as the money in this loan is drawn from acquiring equity in your property. In effect both home loans use your property as security. Your first mortgage will always take priority and your second mortgage is therefore ranked behind it. If you should default on your payments then your first mortgage will be repaid before your second one. If the property is sold and there are insufficient funds to pay both mortgages, your first mortgage will still be paid in full and the rest will go towards the amount owed on the second mortgage. Unsurprisingly, this is one of the reasons why it is much harder to find a lender willing to lend you a second mortgage as opposed to a first one.</p>\n<p>One extra important point to remember is that you must seek permission from your existing home loan provider in order to meet the application criteria for a second mortgage.</p>\n<h3>What are the risks and rewards?</h3>\n<p>The benefits you can receive from a second mortgage are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extra cash to allow you to take care of home repairs or renovations;</li>\n<li>Help towards consolidating your debts;</li>\n<li>The ability to access the equity in your home;</li>\n<li>The capacity to act as guarantor for a friend or family member.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Among the drawbacks and the risks are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficulty identifying a lender willing to advance further funds, as many are cautious about second mortgages;</li>\n<li>Failing to manage both loans effectively and risking defaults or late payments;</li>\n<li>Higher fees if you are granted your second mortgage because of wary lenders;</li>\n<li>Increasing your level of debt, potentially undermining the affordability of repayments;</li>\n<li>Lower allowable loan to value (LVR) ratios than with your first mortgage.</li>\n</ul>",,260,27,229,215,9780,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1084.1,98.0

It can be trickier in terms of getting approval for a mortgage and careful financial planning will be required to meet your monthly repayments, but it's by no means impossible. You're as entitled as any family to own your own home so when you begin your research it's worth getting advice from a mortgage broker.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are </strong><strong>single income home loans</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>These are essentially no different to other home loans but they take into account the fact that there is only one income available to make the repayments, as well as funding all the other day-to-day costs of living. In practice this means you are likely to have to produce a number of documents relating to your finances, such as proof of income and identity as well as information about debts and assets. If you are using a guarantor, such as a family member or friend, you'll be asked to provide documentary evidence of this. <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/low-interest"">Single income home loans</a></span> are definitely available; you may just have to jump through more financial hoops than other borrowers.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do </strong><strong>single income home loans</strong><strong> compare to other products?</strong></h3>\n<p>With many different types of home loan available you should do in-depth research to look at what options best suit your financial circumstances. Some lenders anxious to attract customers may offer no fees for applying, which could save you a deal of money upfront. Others may have introductory offers with low interest rates for an initial period so these types of deals are worth exploring to try to keep your initial costs down. If you are on a single income you could still have some savings, and some of these could be put into an offset account, so that you pay less interest on the principal amount you were loaned.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of </strong><strong>single income home loans</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>The two most common types of single income home loans are those that offer a fixed interest or variable rate. Fixed rate mortgages mean exactly that. You will pay the same every month for a fixed period without the repayments increasing. With a <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/variable-rate"">variable rate</a></span> mortgage any interest base rate change could mean repayments going up or down depending how the central bank decides to increase or decrease interest rates and whether your lender passes a rise or fall on to you.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong></h3>\n<p>Being on a single income means that lenders are likely to consider you a riskier prospect than families with a dual income, which is why you will undergo some fairly forensic financial investigation by the lender. Finding deals that lower your upfront costs and give you repayments that are affordable on the single income can be found, so it's sensible to make plenty of comparisons between products before taking a final decision on the provider to sign up with.</p>",,5,2,22,30,625,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,71.8,241.0

The capital therefore experiences a high demand for property from people currently living in the state or intending to move to the area from other states. The South Australia economy fluctuates with the national and international economy and some local factors. The state government offers a variety of incentives to encourage people to build properties as well as tempting first home buyers into the property market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What do I need to know about the South Australia property market and economy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Due to the availability of jobs, established industry, cultural and entertainment elements in South Australia&rsquo;s capital, there is always a demand for property in this city. The state economy is dominated by agricultural, manufacturing and mining industries and can be affected by the volatility of these industries. The state&rsquo;s rental market is usually strong with low vacancy rates.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Why should I get a home loan in South Australia?</strong></h2>\n<p>Basically for affordability, because prices for properties in and around the Adelaide area are often lower than those in comparable capital cities. In addition, due to demand these properties are usually easier to resell or rent. The South Australian government has also recently reduced the amount charged for stamp duty (see below) making it cheaper than ever before to own property in South Australia.</p>\n<h2><strong>Are there any disadvantages to getting a home loan in South Australia?</strong></h2>\n<p>The South Australia government has similar laws and regulations regarding <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">home loans</a> as other states in Australia. However, the&nbsp;economy can be heavily influenced by national and international impacts on the mining and agricultural industries and that may affect property prices and housing availability. Also, the state is subject to extreme weather and natural events, including fire, high temperatures and monsoon type rain events, and flooding. The risks vary with location so do your research before purchase.</p>\n<h2><strong>What fees and charges will I have to pay?</strong></h2>\n<p>Like all Australian states, if purchasing a property in South Australia in most cases you will have to pay a Stamp Duty on Transfer of Real Property and an annual Land Tax. The Stamp Duty can be a substantial amount and you should <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">budget</a> for it before applying for a home loan. It is calculated based on the value of the property and can often be in the tens of thousands of dollars. An Emergency Services Levy is also charged by the state government annually for each fixed property owned. You will also have to look into the ongoing rates and levies charged by the council region your property is located in.</p>\n<h2><strong>Are there any grants or discounts I can apply for?</strong></h2>\n<p>The South Australian government offers discounts and exemptions for people in special circumstances. These include if the property is transferred between married couples or domestic partners or if it is part of a deceased&rsquo;s estate. The government also provides a First Home Owner Grant (FHOG) of between $5,000 and $20,000 for first home buyers who are purchasing or building a new property. There are many conditions attached to these grants and they are subject to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,110,16,87,102,3398,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,387.15,157.0

The sensible way to approach the possibility of taking out a home loan &ndash; it's unlikely that you'll ever take out such a large loan for anything else &ndash; is to take the time to do some careful and detailed research and compare the range of options available. One such option is called split loans, and below is some information on how these work.</p>\n<h2>What are split loans?</h2>\n<p>To set these in context, you need to remember that a loan you take out has to be repaid in full plus the interest charges &ndash; it may sound obvious, but it's worth stating so that you are under no illusions as to what you're taking on. There are different ways to arrange repayments of your loan, even if it is a relatively small one, but for larger home loans, you need to weigh up what will be the best way to make repayments on a monthly basis that isn&rsquo;t going to stretch your finances. Let's look at the three main ways that you could arrange to pay off your loan.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Split interest loans: loans are usually repaid - when they are for a mortgage - either by variable interest, fixed interest or split interest. Split interest is when you have a blend of a variable rate and a fixed rate. When you choose this, a part of your monthly payments are paid at an initial interest rate, but that can be varied depending on the rise or fall in interest rates. The fixed rate part of split rates is a level of interest that you have agreed with your lender over a specific period of time. It doesn't change, and though you wouldn't benefit from a drop in interest rates, you're protected from a rise in them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed rate loans: as above, this is where your lender offers you a rate that stays the same for the agreed period. It can help you control your cash flow and can be useful in terms of a split loan to give you a measure of control as to what you will repay every month.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Variable rate loans: if you're comfortable with the possibility of your loan interest rate going either up or down depending on how interest rates are set by the central bank, a variable rate is probably what you would go for. When this is part of a split rate agreement, you have the certainty of your fixed rate and the potential for your variable mortgage rate to go down. It could, of course, go up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Are there rewards and risks with split loans?</h2>\n<p>You have more control over your rates than solely with a variable interest rate loan, and you will own your property if your repayments are completed in the agreed mortgage term. If you default on a split loan, you are in danger of losing your home.</p>",,5,3,25,25,1904,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,199.9,185.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong>Switching home loans</strong></h1>\n<p>Not so long ago the vast majority of borrowers stuck with their initial lenders throughout the duration of their home loans; however, during the last decade around a million Australians have opted to switch providers partway through, often getting a better deal as a result. It&rsquo;s now easier to switch than ever before, and though it isn&rsquo;t the best option for everybody, there are circumstances in which it can save you a lot of money. Could it be right for you?</p>\n<h3><strong>Why switch lender?</strong></h3>\n<p>Although you may have spent a long time finding the best terms available when you originally took out your loan, the market will have changed since then and it&rsquo;s quite possible that another lender&rsquo;s terms will now be better. What&rsquo;s more, some lenders offer special terms and bonuses to borrowers who switch. This means that switching is often a better way to change your loan terms than simple refinancing.</p>\n<p>Just as the markets have undergone change, you may find that your personal circumstances have changed as well. For instance, you might now be in a position to pay your loan off more quickly, reducing the overall cost.</p>\n<h3><strong>When should you switch?</strong></h3>\n<p>Whatever you&rsquo;re shopping for, it&rsquo;s always better to do it at a time when sellers are under pressure and are anxious not to miss out on your custom. This applies just as much when it comes to financial products. When the market is highly competitive for lenders (which roughly corresponds with slumps or delays in expected rises in the housing market, a sign that fewer people are borrowing), you can get much better deals.</p>\n<h3><strong>Main considerations</strong></h3>\n<p>Getting it right is just as critical when you&rsquo;re switching home loans as it is when you first go looking for a loan, so take your time to make sure you can find a good value product. Once you&rsquo;ve done so, talk to your current lender about your intentions, as they may offer you a better deal in an attempt to get you to stay. Bear in mind that if you have fixed interest rates then you may have to pay hefty charges to end your current arrangement, and if you have under 20 per cent equity you&nbsp;may be&nbsp;required to pay mortgage insurance.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Pros and cons of switching</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You could pay less interest or pay off your loan more quickly;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You could get access to extra features that better suit your circumstances;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You could benefit from introductory rates offered by your new lender;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Depending on the loan you have, there may be charges for leaving your current lender;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need to set aside time for researching loans and finding a good deal.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>",,210,5,44,40,2174,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,253.5,170.0

The housing market reflects its popularity, with property prices in Sydney being some of the highest in Australia. As you can imagine, high property values impact the chance of you being successful in acquiring a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan</a> to purchase a property in the area. Larger than average home loans and hefty deposits are usually required when purchasing property in the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img style=""width: 100%;"" class="""" alt=""View of the iconic Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge from Mrs Macquarie's Chair, Sydney, Australia."" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161019132155/iStock_71902803_SMALL.jpg"" width=""848"" height=""565"" /> View of the iconic Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge from Mrs Macquarie's Chair, Sydney, Australia.</p>\n<h2>What should I know about Sydney?</h2>\n<p>Sydney is a large and densely populated city with inner suburbs, outer suburbs and the North Shore area incorporating northern beaches and the eastern suburbs. The inner suburbs start from Sydney Cove - the world&rsquo;s largest natural harbour - and overlook the world famous Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House. Like most cities, the closer you get to the inner suburbs the more expensive the real estate becomes, with the inner suburbs incorporating more high rise&nbsp;apartments&nbsp;than the outer suburbs. Sydney is known for its extensive financial, marketing and tourism industries that drive both the wealth and employment of the city. It is also a hub for foreign tourists and international businesses, such as, banks and multinational corporations.</p>\n<h2><strong>What aspects of the city influence home loans in Sydney?</strong></h2>\n<p>With so much demand and little supply, Sydney&rsquo;s housing market is always under intense pressure and there is a pressing need for more housing developments. Unfortunately, Sydney lacks spare land with little space left to create new houses and developments. With the city&rsquo;s location on a harbour, there is also limited opportunity to develop on the edges of the city so the outer suburbs are experiencing excessive development. Also, the large amount of historical and heritage listed property in Sydney also prevents new property development on some land. High-rises and multiple dwelling accommodations have become popular with this style of living being cheaper than the typical single story house.</p>\n<h2><strong>How does this compare to other major cities in Australia?</strong></h2>\n<p>Sydney&rsquo;s closest relative, Melbourne, also generally suffers a property shortage due to the increase in demand. Melbourne, like Sydney, is a hub for several national and multinational organisations and is an attractive location for job seekers. With slightly less demand than Sydney and Melbourne the cities of Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra have less supply and demand problems but still have rising property prices.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What do I need to know about getting a home loan in Sydney?&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></h2>\n<p>If you are a first home buyer or on a limited income it may&nbsp;be difficult to obtain an adequate <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">home loan</a> in the city because of the current high level of demand that is pushing up prices. Home loan providers, therefore, may be more hesitant to accept applications and you may have go further to show you are capable of paying off the home loan. The demand for housing in Sydney may also reduce the amount of housing up for sale at any one time. You may have to search for longer to find a property that both suits your needs and your budget. You will have to take this into account when finalising your home loan.</p>",,320,0,0,1,656,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,97.75000000000001,218.0

More than any other state, most of Tasmania&rsquo;s inhabitants live in the main metropolitan areas of Hobart &ndash; the state&rsquo;s capital, and <span>Launceston</span>. This fact promotes demand in these locations; however, property prices in Tasmania are generally cheaper than in most other Australian states.</p>\n<p>The state also has specific duties and taxes as well as grants and concessions that should be taken into account when acquiring a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">home loan</a> in Tasmania.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span><strong>What is Tasmania&rsquo;s economy and property market like?</strong></span></h2>\n<p>In the past decade the Tasmanian property market has been somewhat undervalued, which has now caused a sharp rebound in prices. Though more expensive than in previous years, Tasmania&rsquo;s property prices remain less expensive than other states. This includes both Hobart and Launceston, which have average property prices well below the averages of similar cities, such as, Brisbane and Canberra.</p>\n<p>Despite the cheaper property prices, Tasmania suffers from high rental market demand. This results in limited supply with rental prices generally high for the main towns of Tasmania.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span><strong>Is it easy to get a home loan in Tasmania?</strong></span></h2>\n<p>The legal systems underpinning Tasmania&rsquo;s property market are similar to most states across Australia. Due to the state&rsquo;s smaller population and high rental demand, there is usually high interest from interstate and foreign investors. In addition, you will find demand is highest in Hobart and Launceston, which have more employment opportunities and provide a better quality of life than other parts of Tasmania.</p>\n<p>Tasmania is more susceptible than other states in Australia to cold weather spells, including strong winds and periods of snow. It is recommended you should ensure the property you are looking at purchasing can withstand the weather conditions and is fully insulated.</p>\n<h2><span><strong>What are the costs and fees of buying a property in Tasmania?</strong></span></h2>\n<p>If you purchase a property or land in Tasmania, the state government requires you pay both a Property Transfer Duty (formerly stamp duty) and a Land Tax. These are common fees in most states across the country and are calculated based on the value of the property. You should ensure these are budgeted for before securing your <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">home loan</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span><strong>Can I get any grants or concessions for getting a home loan?</strong></span></h2>\n<p>The Tasmania government offers grants for first home buyers looking to get into the local market. The main two are <span>First Home Owner Grant (FHOG) and First Home Builder Boost (FHBB). You will only be eligible for these one-off payments if you are buying or building a new home. The Tasmanian government offers several concessions for both the land tax and property transfer duty it you have special circumstances. These include if it is your principle place of residence or if the property is transferred between partners who are married or in a significant relationship. These grants and concessions often change and should be fully researched before making an application.</span></p>",,70,14,52,71,4156,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,448.05,148.0

With the fixed rate your repayments remain the same until the end of an agreed period, helping you to plan your finances, whereas a variable rate means your payments could go up or down depending on the base interest rate set by the central bank. Offset accounts are a good way of reducing the amount of interest you pay. These are linked to the mortgage, so if have $10,000 in the account it will reduce the amount of interest the lender will charge on the principal loan.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong></p>\n<p>Refinancing can be a good way to reset your home loan finances but you need to look at every aspect in detail, especially with regard to the fees associated with finishing your current loan and taking out a new one. Ensure you are not putting yourself in a worse financial position by investigating a wide range of options, an essential part of getting the lowest cost deal suitable for your circumstances.</p>",,4400,0,0,0,1,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,440.1,149.0

These popular home loans offer plenty of financial flexibility, though variable rates aren&rsquo;t ideal for every borrower.</span></p>\n<p><span>At RateCity, you can quickly compare variable rate home loans from a range of different lenders all in one place, and narrow down your shortlist of mortgage options to buy a new home, make a property investment, or to refinance your existing home loan. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Benefits of a variable rate mortgage</span></h3>\n<p style=""text-align: center;""><span><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161208152828/variable-interest-rate.jpeg""><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-60182"" alt=""Variable Interest Rate"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161208152828/variable-interest-rate.jpeg"" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span>Home loans with variable interest rates can often prove to be quite affordable. Because most lenders base their variable interest rates on the RBA&rsquo;s official cash rate, if the cash rate falls, your lender may pass this rate cut on to you, lowering your home loan repayments. Smaller repayments can make more money available in your budget to save or spend as you please, though one possible option could be to pay extra onto your mortgage and get ahead of your scheduled repayments. This can bring you closer to paying your loan off ahead of schedule, potentially reducing the total amount of interest you&rsquo;ll pay over the lifetime of your loan.</span></p>\n<p><span>Variable rate mortgages also tend to be more flexible than their fixed rate counterparts, which are more likely to lock you into set repayment plans with restrictions on making additional repayments. Plus, with a variable rate home loan, you&rsquo;re more likely to enjoy access to optional bonus features, such as offset accounts or redraw facilities. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Risks&nbsp;of a variable rate mortgage</span></h3>\n<p><span>There are financial risks with every home loan, including variable rate mortgages. If the RBA increases Australia&rsquo;s official cash rate, your lender will likely pass this rate rise on to you, increasing the cost of your repayments. It&rsquo;s possible that an extended period of regular interest rate rises could leave you in financial stress, struggling to repay a loan that was once easily affordable. </span></p>\n<p><span>Also, it&rsquo;s important to remember that many lenders charge fees as well as interest on their home loans, which can make a big difference to their overall cost to you. Home loans with low interest rates and high fees can sometimes turn out to be more expensive in total than those with higher interest rates and lower fees.</span></p>\n<h4><span>Variable Rate Home Loan Pros & Cons</span></h4>\n<div class=""pros-cons"">\n<div class=""pros col-sm-6"">\n<div class=""pro-con-header"">\n<h5 class=""floating-title""><span class=""fa fa-thumbs-o-up""></span>Pros</h5>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Interest rate cuts can reduce repayments</li>\n<li>Flexible repayment options</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=""cons col-sm-6"">\n<div class=""pro-con-header"">\n<h5 class=""floating-title""><span class=""fa fa-thumbs-o-down""></span>Cons</h5>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Interest rate rises can increase repayment</li>\n<li>Less consistent budgeting</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><span>Comparison Rates</span></h3>\n<p><span>To get a better idea of the potential impact that different home loans may have on your finances, look at their Comparison Rates.

If rates rise, the fixed percentage will help to keep your repayments stable and affordable. And if rates fall, you&rsquo;ll still enjoy some savings on repayments for the variable percentage. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Loan term length</span></h3>\n<p><span><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161208161318/time-and-money.jpg""><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" alt=""time and money"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161208161318/time-and-money.jpg"" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span>Most home loans have terms of 25 or 30 years, though shorter and longer options are also available. It&rsquo;s important to consider how long you want to take to pay off your mortgage, partially because the longer your loan term, the greater the likelihood that your variable interest rate will rise, and bring up your home loan&rsquo;s repayments with it. </span></p>\n<p><span>What&rsquo;s more, the longer your home loan, the more repayments you&rsquo;ll need to make, each one for a smaller percentage of your loan&rsquo;s principal. This can help to keep your loan&rsquo;s monthly cost more affordable, however the increased number of repayments could lead to you paying more interest in total over the lifetime of the loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>Shorter home loans allow you to get your property fully paid off more quickly by paying a greater percentage of the principal each month. While this can make your repayments more expensive, you&rsquo;ll likely pay less in total interest over the lifetime of your loan.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>See how term length affects repayments</h6>\n<h3>Home Loan Calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">Try Today</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><span>Deposit options</span></h3>\n<p><span>You&rsquo;re often more likely to enjoy lower variable interest rates on your mortgage if you can afford a full deposit on your property, as this added security helps to reduce the lender&rsquo;s risk. The deposit size required for a mortgage varies by lender, though 20% of the property&rsquo;s value is common.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you can&rsquo;t afford a full deposit on the property you want, there may still be home loan options available to you. Some lenders offer mortgages with a high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), where you pay a smaller deposit and borrow a greater percentage of the property&rsquo;s value. However, your lender may require you to pay Lender&rsquo;s Mortgage Insurance (LMI) to keep them protected in case you default on your loan.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6>How much will LMI cost you?</h6>\n<h3>LMI Calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" href=""http://ratecity.com.au/home-loans/lmi-calculator"">Find Out</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>Alternatively, you may be able to have a parent or other close relative serve as your guarantor, using the equity in their property to guarantee your home loan in lieu of a deposit.

As well as serving as a typical bank account of its kind, any money paid into an offset account is included when your lender calculates the interest owing on your mortgage. </span></p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-example"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">Example:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve paid back <strong>$200,000</strong> of a <strong>$500,000</strong> loan, and have <strong>$15,000</strong> in your offset account, your next interest payment will be calculated as if you only owed your lender <strong>$285,000</strong>, rather than <strong>$300,000</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>A Redraw Facility is another nice little feature that can help encourage you to minimise your home loan&rsquo;s interest. A redraw facility allows you to withdraw any surplus balance you&rsquo;ve paid onto your loan, subject to your lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. Being able to free this money up in case of emergency can be quite handy, and allow you to add spare cash onto your home loan with confidence. By making extra repayments onto your mortgage, you&rsquo;ll get ahead of schedule and come closer to making an early exit from the home loan, reducing the total amount of interest you&rsquo;ll pay.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Variable rates from banks and non-bank lenders</span></h3>\n<p><span><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161209091141/choosing-a-lender.jpeg""><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" alt=""Saving to buy a house, piggy bank and house"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161209091141/choosing-a-lender.jpeg"" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span>A variable rate home loan from a bank may allow you to enjoy additional benefits from the bank&rsquo;s other services, such as transaction accounts, credit cards and more.

However, these smaller lenders may not be able to offer the same kind of value-adding features as certain banks.

This has affected property prices with strong growth figures a feature of the Victorian market. <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">Home loans</a> and individual properties are, therefore, very competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the Victorian economy and property market like?</strong></h2>\n<p>Due to large levels of available jobs and high standard of living, Victoria is a popular state for people to settle both from overseas and interstate locations. The industries that fuel the state&rsquo;s economy are mainly in the service sectors and tourism. Most people are employed by these industries.</p>\n<p>The state&rsquo;s high population density has contributed to a shortage in detached properties and land. There are a large proportion of apartments in the state with investors and developers meeting the demand for housing by building more apartment and townhouse blocks. This need for housing, however, is less than Victoria&rsquo;s closest comparison state, New South Wales.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the positives and negatives of getting a home loan in Victoria?</strong></h2>\n<p>The booming economy in the state will ensure properties in Victoria will always be sought after and in demand. This level of interest increases the closer you get to the Melbourne CBD.</p>\n<p>Property prices can vary from suburb to suburb and should be researched to ensure you are getting the <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/calculator"">best deal</a>. Victoria, especially its regional areas, can be susceptible to natural events - most commonly bushfires - and this should be taken into account when buying a property. This would be relevant for houses close to vegetation or in areas that have suffered from fires in the past. This will affect the price of the property as well as future home insurance premiums.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What fees and charges will I have to pay when getting a home loan and Victoria?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The Victorian state government as well as council regions will charge you fees and levies when purchasing a property, and following the sale. The main tax is the Land Transfer Duty that is charged for the cost of transferring the property from one individual to another. This is charged based on the value of your property.&nbsp; In some cases you may have to pay a Land Tax if the property is an investment or business premises.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Does the Victoria state government offer any incentives for getting a home loan in the state?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Victorian government offers several grants and discounts to people wanting to get a home loan in the state who have special circumstances. These generally revolve around first home buyers who can apply for a First Home Owner Grant, a first home buyer duty reduction and a principal place of residence duty concession.&nbsp; These come with special requirements and should be researched before applying.</p>\n<p>Other groups, such as, young farmers can also apply for duty discounts or exemptions.</p>",,50,0,8,7,374,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,44.65,273.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the home loan that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong>Home loans in WA</strong></h1>\n<p>Due to external factors, the WA economy and property market tend to be less robust and productive than the states in southeast Australia. Similar to most states, the population in WA increases near the coast with most of the state&rsquo;s inhabitants living in the southwest corner - close to the capital Perth - and the northwest corner. To attract buyers and developers, the WA government offer several incentives and grant schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the WA economy and property market like?</strong></h2>\n<p>The largest state in Australia, Western Australia (WA) relies on the agricultural and mining industries to bolster the state&rsquo;s economy. These industries are heavily influenced by uncontrollable factors, such as the weather and international economic changes, and can be volatile and unreliable. Its large area of unusable land and susceptibility to extreme weather events also affects the state&rsquo;s economy. All these factors affect WA&rsquo;s overall wealth, the property market and rates of <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">home loan</a> applications. In recent years the WA property market has been in a decline with prices reducing below the average levels in other states.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>How will these factors affect me getting a home loan?</strong></h2>\n<p>WA has less demand for property than other states, such as, NSW and Victoria. Therefore, property prices may be lower than in other states and due to fewer potential buyers it may be easier for you to find and purchase a suitable property. These factors make it easier to successfully obtain a home loan in WA.</p>\n<h2><strong>Are there any secret costs in getting a home loan in WA?</strong></h2>\n<p>As the WA property market is governed by both state and council rules and regulations, you may have to pay fees to both the governing bodies. The council fees and rates will vary depending on the council region you are purchasing in and the type of property you are looking to buy. The state government charges taxes on the transfer of the property to your name. The amount you pay for the &lsquo;transfer tax&rsquo;, formerly &lsquo;stamp duty&rsquo; will be determined by the value of your property.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Does WA offer any incentives for purchasing a property or land?</strong></h2>\n<p>Like most states in Australia, the WA government offers incentives for first home buyers looking to get into the market. The amount you could receive varies depending on whether you are purchasing a new or established home. Also, to be eligible for the grant there may be a cap on the value of the property with properties above a certain value not being eligible for the grant. The government currently also offers a Home Buyers Assistance Account (HBAA) that provides first time buyers with funds for incidental expenses. However, both this and other schemes are often subject to changes and you should always fully research the laws and regulations before applying for a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare"">home loan</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,260,40,175,168,4193,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,516.75,138.0

It doesn't have to be terribly complicated, however, you should do your homework before making a decision on what is the best type of home loan for your circumstances.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are</strong><strong> home loans with free offset accounts</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p><span>Home loans with free offset accounts</span> work as a regular transaction account that is linked to your home loan. You can save money as you reduce the amount of interest that's charged on the balance of your loan. It's a free feature and means that with each monthly repayment made there will be more money applied to the principal balance. Any funds you hold in the account, provided it's a 100 per cent offset account, will offset the amount of interest you are charged on the home loan. There are free offset accounts and those that charge monthly fees, so be sure of what you are signing up to if you are looking for the free option.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>How do </strong><strong>home loans with free offset accounts </strong><strong>compare to other products?</strong></h3>\n<p>All home loan products have different features so you need to work out what is the most appropriate route to take. Although some are advertised as being free, check that you won't be charged any additional fees for the service, for example application fees, higher annual fees or higher interest rates. Look at comparison rates too, as well as the interest rate advertised, and be aware that some lenders may offer offset accounts at relatively low percentages. This could impact on the amount of money you will save over the years in terms of interest payments on the loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of </strong><strong>home loans with free offset accounts</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>This type of home loan can be of benefit if you have some savings and want to use them to reduce the amount of interest you pay on your home loan. When you take out a home loan under with this feature&nbsp;you have the potential to save a considerable amount of interest, provided you have a reasonable sum of money to offset. As an example, if you take out a <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/mortgage-rates"">home loan</a></span> of $250,000 and have $20,000 in your offset account, interest will only be charged on $230,000. Daily interest is thus calculated on a lower amount and you may therefore be able to pay off the loan more quickly than expected.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong></h3>\n<p>Before you take out any home loan product always check the small print to make sure you are getting exactly what you expect. Ensure that 100 per cent of the offset account balance is deducted from your home loan balance before interest is calculated for the day. Make sure also that you can deposit and withdraw funds from the account when you want to, either online, through a teller or at an ATM. There may be times when you need some ready cash from your savings and you need to weigh up the impact that could have in terms of the interest you will then be charged if your offset account balance reduces.&nbsp;</p>",,5,51,189,199,2840,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,368.2,160.0

One of these specialist home loans presents an opportunity to make the most of your spending through a rewards program. Home loans with a free Qantas Frequent Flyer credit card can help you to maximise the benefits you get back. For example, when you use your credit card for certain purchases from particular outlets, you earn Qantas Points. You can accumulate and then redeem these points for one or more of an impressive range of rewards.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why earn Qantas Points through a home loan?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not necessarily a big spender when it comes to using credit cards, but you are a frequent flyer, there&rsquo;s a home loan that earns Qantas Points simply by repaying your loan. As long as your loan terms qualify and you keep your balance over the minimum required you will regularly receive Qantas Points. With a growing balance you will be able to access a whole host of benefits, including travel insurance, Qantas hotels, flights and upgrades, Qantas epiQure and purchases from the Qantas store.

For example if you draw $500,000, you get 50,000 Qantas Points. While the outstanding loan balance is equal to or more than an amount fixed by the lender, you will receive an additional 1,000 Qantas Points on a monthly basis. On the third and fifth anniversaries of your loan, as long as the balance is equal to or more than the amount fixed by the lender, you get an extra 25,000 bonus Qantas Points.</em></p>\n<p>When your loan is approved, you may also be entitled to an additional credit card through which you can also earn Qantas Points. As a member of the Qantas Frequent Flyer program, your points will accrue in your personal frequent flyer account.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the rewards and risks?</strong></h3>\n<p>The ability to use rewards points to pay for airline fares is a definite plus, whether you usually fly business. If you don&rsquo;t travel often, you can still redeem your Qantas Points for a variety of items sold by business partners that subscribe to the rewards program.</p>\n<p>If you accumulate points but never get around to using them, they have effectively been wasted. Be sure to use the points within the given period to ensure they don&rsquo;t lapse.</p>",,5,7,68,67,1988,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,223.05,174.0

One product you may want to consider is a home loan with a linked Visa debit card. This provides extra convenience when you need to use some of the money you have in an offset account.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>What are</strong><strong> home loans with linked Visa debit cards</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>To access <span>home loans with linked visa debit cards</span> you will need to have an offset account. This can then be linked to your Visa debit card so you have the convenience of spending some money from that account when needed. An offset account contains funds that substitute for part of the principal sum you have borrowed, and it can be accessed for drawdown without necessarily linking it with a visa debit card. It comes down to how you want to access the funds in your offset account and how quickly you want that access. The advantage of an offset account is that the amount of interest you pay on your loan amount will be reduced, although you should always check the interest rate you are paying, and consider whether it is likely to go up or down if you choose a variable rate.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do </strong><strong>home loans with linked visa debit cards </strong><strong>compare to other products?</strong></h3>\n<p>This type of loan requires you to have an offset account, and if you don't have the money to put into such an account you'll need to examine other options.

Add in the linkage to a visa debit card and you could give yourself additional control over the account funds and how to access some of the money if you need to.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of </strong><strong>home loans with linked Visa debit cards</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Keeping control of your money is a major feature of home loans with linked Visa debit cards. You could also save a considerable amount of interest on your<span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/compare""> home loan</a></span> by using this product, however, bear in mind that to see that advantage you must be disciplined in your spending.</p>\n<h3><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>If you decide to go for a home loan with a linked Visa debit card you need to keep a watchful eye on your expenditure. Each time you take money from your offset account you will be reducing the amount that is offset against your principal loan, so your daily interest rate will increase. It's not a problem as long as you keep control and, where you can, replenish the funds so you don't continue to pay additional interest. Remember too that as with any home loan you should always keep up with your monthly repayments or you could, in a worst case scenario, be in danger of your home being repossessed.</p>",,5,0,0,0,2,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.7,557.5

The same is true of banks that now use various incentives so that if you borrow from them you are rewarded in some way. The object is to prevent you moving to another lender, which you are now entitled to do without paying exit fees; those fees were outlawed by the Australian government in 2011.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are</strong><strong> home loans with loyalty discounts</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Every bank that offers home loans, no matter what type they are, wants to keep your custom, so many are now offering <span>home loans with loyalty discounts</span>. The plan is to get you to keep your current loan instead of seeking an alternative provider that may have more attractive offers in terms of fixed or variable interest rates. So as a loyal customer your bank might reward you by organising a significant discount on your loan, though you are likely to have to commit to that loan for an agreed amount of time to benefit. Your bank might offer you a lower interest rate after a time, some three years or so, and that would give you an incentive to stick with it. A lower interest rate means you save money in the long term whether or not your mortgage is fixed or <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/variable-rate"">variable</a></span>, but it's your bank that will decide what you may be offered.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do </strong><strong>home loans with loyalty discounts </strong><strong>compare to other products?</strong></h3>\n<p>Lenders are not only always trying to get your custom but also to keep it. There are many differing offers in terms of interest charges, fees and variable rates that are designed to attract your business. Home loans with loyalty discounts can be an attractive option if you discover that a reduced interest rate or a discount on your home loan makes financial sense for you. It is wise search the market to see what competing lenders are offering in terms of loyalty discounts and check initial interest rates to see how competitive they are. A slightly high rate at first, even though it may drop, may not always be the cheapest option in the long term.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of </strong><strong>home loans with loyalty discounts</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>\n<p>There is potential for reducing interest costs with a loan such as this, as well as benefiting from lower fees, although it's always wise to make a range of comparisons both for the short and long term so that you are comfortable it is the best product for your financial circumstances.</p>\n<h3><strong>Are there risks to consider?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Whenever you look at your options there are various things you should check, and home loans with loyalty discounts have pros and potential cons. You could benefit from lower interest rates and discounts after a period of time, but you should examine whether or not you are getting the best rate and whether the loyalty rate has an expiry date. It is also very important to keep up to date with your mortgage payments to avoid any penalties.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Personal Loans that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h3><strong>Personal loans in Adelaide</strong></h3>\n<p>More than 75 per cent of South Australia&rsquo;s 1.7 million inhabitants live in the state capital, Adelaide. The city centre is home to many financial institutions and ranks highly in terms of quality of life. Undoubtedly this is helped by the ready availability of finance to support the individual, which is often in the form of personal loans.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do personal loans in Adelaide work?</strong></h3>\n<p>You can apply for personal loans from banks and non-bank lenders. Personal loans are more flexible than home loans and can be used for many purposes. Between them, the lenders offer plenty of different types of <span>personal loans in Adelaide</span>, which come with a variety of features. If you have a particular project in mind, however, you need to check the policies of individual lenders and review their terms and conditions carefully to make sure you are eligible for a personal loan from them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use personal loans in Adelaide?</strong></h3>\n<p>Adelaideans use personal loans for many different things. These include providing support for college and university students, making repairs to their homes and buying boats and cars. Some people&nbsp;also use a personal loan for the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acting as guarantor for a friend or family member;</li>\n<li>Consolidating debts if your lender agrees this is worthwhile risk;</li>\n<li>Dealing with unforeseen emergencies;</li>\n<li>Paying for unexpected medical treatment.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Certain lenders permit interest-only payments for some or all of the loan period. This means your repayments will be less expensive, which can help your cashflow. However, you will still owe the same amount you borrowed originally at the end of the interest-only period.</p>\n<p>Some financial institutions allow you to make extra repayments, enabling you to pay your personal loan off early, but it&rsquo;s important to check whether there are any restrictions that apply to how often you can do this and by how much you can overpay without being penalised.</p>\n<p>Some lenders also offer redraw facilities, a feature that permits you to reclaim extra repayments&nbsp;you have previously made.&nbsp; Again, you need to check if restrictions apply and whether the lender in question charges for this facility.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your personal loan agreement may also be linked to other financial products, such as transaction accounts, savings accounts and credit cards.

You might want to consolidate high-interest debts, purchase a new car or renovate your home. Whatever the reason, there are options available for those who find themselves a little short.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Where do I start though?&rdquo; is the question that comes up frequently in relation to personal loans in Australia. The following guide might help clarify the process.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Choosing a personal loan in Australia</h3>\n<p>The first thing you'll need to do when you're looking at Australian personal loans is to figure out what exactly you want from your loan. Your loan&rsquo;s purpose is important because lenders often assess your suitability for a personal loan based on what your loan purpose is. For example, some lenders are OK with you borrowing for a renovation, but not for a wedding.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>How much to borrow</h3>\n<p>Before you apply for the loan, it's critical you figure out how much exactly you wish to borrow and, importantly, whether you will be able to repay that amount.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once this has been decided, consider conducting research into the following:</p>\n<p><strong>The loan&rsquo;s term:</strong> While spreading your repayments across several years could lead to smaller weekly or monthly repayments, this might also increase the amount of interest you pay overtime.</p>\n<p><strong>Your credit provider:</strong> Consider using ASIC <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asics-registers/professional-registers/"">professional registers</a> search to check whether your lender is licensed.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated fees:</strong> Some loans involve various associated fees, which can be discussed with your lender.</p>\n<p><strong>Early exit fees:</strong> Some loans charge a fee if the total borrowed amount is repaid prior to the loan&rsquo;s fixed term.</p>\n<h3>Secured vs unsecured</h3>\n<p>Both secured loans and unsecured loans in Australia have associated benefits as well as risks, so the type of personal loan most suited to your situation will depend on your purpose for applying for a loan.</p>\n<p>A secured loan refers to a loan which is tied to an asset. Most commonly offered for assets such as cars and homes, secured loans are generally granted on the premise that the associated assets act as a guarantee, thereby giving the lender the ability to reposes the asset and sell it to obtain the amount owing if you default on your loan. This reduces the risk factor for the lender, which is why you might find that the interest rates associated with secured loans can be lower than those associated with the alternative&mdash;unsecured loans.</p>\n<p>Unsecured loans are loans which do not require security on the borrower&rsquo;s part. Such loans are generally granted for smaller amounts than secure loans, for personal discretionary purposes such as renovations, travel or medical bills. Some lenders might allow you to nominate family members to act as guarantors for unsecured loans, thereby reducing the risk associated with the loan for the lender.</p>\n<h3>All about interest rates</h3>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve decided on a type of loan, the next step is to examine the associated interest rates and work out whether&nbsp;repayments are affordable for you. Interest rates on personal loans in Australia can vary significantly, so it's important to find a personal loan that offers all your essential features, without costing you too much each month in interest. The higher the interest rate, the more you will have to repay on top of the amount borrowed in the long run.</p>\n<p>When researching personal loans, you will come across two main types of interest rate &ndash; fixed interest rates and variable interest rates.</p>\n<p>Opting for a personal loan with a fixed interest rate can be beneficial as the rate will remain the same for the duration of the personal loan, regardless of market rates. That being said, if market rates happen to drop, you will still be bound to the fixed interest rate you agreed to.</p>\n<p>Variable interest rates, on the other hand, fluctuate with market rates. While they do leave you with the risk of having to adhere to a very high interest if market rates increase significantly, they will also allow you to benefit from a lower rate if market rates drop.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Are personal loans regulated?</h3>\n<p>The short answer the that question is yes. The National Credit Act sets the rules for providers and consumers of credit, including personal loans in Australia.</p>\n<p>According to <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/borrowing-and-credit/consumer-credit-regulation"">ASIC</a></span>, &ldquo;Anyone who wants to engage in credit activities (including lenders, lessors and<span>&nbsp;</span><span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/glossary/b/broker"">brokers</a></span>) must be licensed with ASIC or be a representative of someone who is licensed (that is, they must either have their own licence or come under the umbrella of another licensee as an authorised credit representative or employee).&rdquo; The law also specifies that credit providers should not enter into contracts which are unsuitable &ndash; the borrower&rsquo;s financial situation and ability to meet repayment requirements must be assessed by the lender prior to entering into the contract. The law also sets parameters for fees and charges allowed on personal loans in Australia.</p>\n<h3>Applying for a personal loan in Australia</h3>\n<p>How easy it is to apply for a personal loan in Australia could depend on your finances and the type of personal loan you are hoping to get approved. Your lender of choice might have personal loan options which suit your needs. Doing your research before committing to a personal loan could assist you to obtain the best financial outcome. Make sure to check out <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans"">RateCity&rsquo;s personal loan comparison page</a> when researching potential loans and lenders.</p>\n<p>Once you decide on a lender and loan amount, approaching the lender with your questions and specification is the next step to take. Most lenders will require you to produce certain documents prior to granting approval, so ensure you have access to these to make the process as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Another option is to consult a finance broker and let them organise the loan on your behalf. Most finance brokers won&rsquo;t charge for the service; instead, they&rsquo;ll earn a commission from the lender.</p>\n<h3>Necessary documents</h3>\n<p>Once you apply for a personal loan you mostly likely will be asked to produce proof of identity, finances and employment, in order for the lender to assess your eligibility for the loan and ability to meet repayment requirements. Examples of documents you might be asked to provide include:</p>\n<p><strong>Proof of identity</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Driver&rsquo;s license</li>\n<li>Passport</li>\n<li>Proof of age card</li>\n<li>Birth certificate</li>\n<li>Utility bills</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Proof of income</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recent pay slips</li>\n<li>Recent tax returns or financial statements</li>\n<li>Recent ATO tax notice of assessment</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Proof of ability to meet repayment requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bank statements</li>\n<li>Credit card statements</li>\n<li>Information on any other loans undertaken</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re applying for a personal loan for the purpose of purchasing a car, you might be asked to provide additional documentation relating to the car and its insurance policy.</p>\n<h3>Pros and cons of personal loans in Australia</h3>\n<p>Being approved for a personal loan could provide you with the financial assistance needed for that big purchase, holiday or renovation you had in mind. A personal loan&rsquo;s interest is also typically lower than that of a credit card, meaning you will have to pay less in interest in the long run. That being said, taking out a personal loan will add to your debt, which might not be ideal for those who already have a large amount owing on a home loan or credit card or other personal loans.</p>\n<p>As with any financial decision, it&rsquo;s important to do your research prior to committing to a loan.

But because you have a range of personal loan options to choose from, such as different interest rates, terms and conditions, then the best personal loan for you is the one that perfectly fits your unique financial situation. </span></p>\n<p><span>To work out which lender can provide the best personal loan for your household, whether you&rsquo;re buying a car, paying for a holiday or consolidating your debts, it&rsquo;s worth comparing the available options at RateCity, and learning more about the features and benefits they offer. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Debt Consolidation</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Not everyone takes out a personal loan to cover a large expense, like a wedding or a holiday. If you&rsquo;ve borrowed money from multiple sources at different interest rates, and are juggling multiple repayments each month, sometimes the simplest option is to take out a personal loan to clear these smaller debts, and just make the one repayment per month to help keep your finances easy to manage. Just remember that not all personal loans can be used for debt consolidation, so it&rsquo;s worth checking with your lender first.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Comparing interest rates</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>While it makes sense that the best personal loans can usually be found among the options with the lowest advertised interest rates, that may not be the whole story. A low-interest personal loan that also charges high fees may ultimately turn out to be the second-best option in terms of total cost when compared with a higher-interest personal loan with lower fees and charges. </span></p>\n<p><span>As well as looking at interest rates, it&rsquo;s usually also worth looking at the Comparison Rates for your personal loan options. Comparison Rates combine each loan&rsquo;s advertised interest rate with its standard fees and charges, and express the total as a single percentage. You can use the Comparison Rate to get a more accurate idea of how much different personal loans could ultimately end up costing you.</span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s also worth taking a closer look at the best personal loan options after you&rsquo;ve narrowed down your selection with the comparison rate. Some personal loans may have nonstandard fees and other costs that aren&rsquo;t expressed in their comparison rate, or may come with extra features and benefits that could influence your final decision.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Fixed vs variable interest rates</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>What&rsquo;s more important to you in a personal loan - making steady progress towards your final goal of getting your loan paid off, or enjoying greater flexibility around how you make your repayments?</span></p>\n<p><span>A fixed interest rate on a personal loan is set at the beginning of its term, and will remain in place until it ends. Regardless of whether economic conditions have your lender raising its rates left and right, you&rsquo;ll still be paying the same amount of principal and interest back on your personal loan every month until it&rsquo;s fully paid off. This simplicity can prove very helpful when organising your monthly budget, as your repayments will be the same every month. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>A variable interest rate may be raised or lowered by your lender over the lifetime of your personal loan. If rates drop, your repayments may drop with them, potentially leaving you with extra savings in your budget. But if rates rise, you could find yourself having to pay more than you expected for your personal loan. Variable rate personal loans are also more likely to offer greater flexibility around their repayment terms, providing more options for repaying your loan, rather than locking you into a fixed term of pre-set monthly repayments.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Extra repayments and early exits</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Making extra payments on your personal loan when you have some extra money to spare can get you ahead of your repayment schedule, and bring you closer to exiting your loan early. This can ultimately mean paying less total interest over the lifetime of your loan, saving you a little extra money. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, some lenders charge early exit and extra repayment fees, to help make up for the extra interest payments they&rsquo;ve be missing out on if you complete your loan term early. These charges are more commonly found in fixed rate personal loan arrangements, where you&rsquo;re expected to follow a set payment plan, though some lenders also charge similar fees for variable rate personal loans. Be sure to check your lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions if you&rsquo;re thinking of trying to save some money by paying off your personal loan early, so it doesn&rsquo;t end up costing you more than you expected. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Redraw facility</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>While the idea of getting ahead on your personal loan repayments may sound appealing, you may feel a bit hesitant about sinking your spare cash into paying off your personal loan. What if there was an emergency and you had no extra money available to cover it?</span></p>\n<p><span>If your lender offers a personal loan that features a redraw facility, you may be able to enjoy the best of both worlds. You&rsquo;ll be able to pay extra money onto your personal loan and get well ahead on your repayments, and also have the option to withdraw this extra money from your loan if required, subject to your lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Secured and Unsecured personal loans</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>A Secured personal loan is where you borrow money from a lender, using a valuable asset you already own as collateral. This asset could be a car, equity in a property, or some other item. If you default on your repayments, the lender seizes your asset to recover its loss. Secured personal loans often have lower interest rates, as they are perceived as less risky to lenders. Many car loans are secured loans, where the borrower puts up the value of the car they&rsquo;re buying as security. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you don&rsquo;t have access to an asset with enough value to cover your personal loan, or if you&rsquo;d prefer not to put your valuable asset at risk as collateral, your best option could be to take out an Unsecured personal loan. However, because these loans are considered to be riskier options, they tend to come with higher interest rates. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>No deposit?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Are you a bit short of savings for a personal loan&rsquo;s deposit? One option could be to look into a personal loan with a high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), where you pay a smaller deposit up front and borrow a greater percentage of your total instead. Some lenders also have 100% loans available, where you borrow the full loan amount and pay no deposit upfront. These loans tend to have higher interest rates due to their higher lender risk, so it&rsquo;s worth considering whether making higher repayments or saving up a deposit would be best for your finances.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare the best personal loans </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Once you have a better idea of which are the best personal loan options for your financial situation, it&rsquo;s time to start comparing the personal loans on the market to find the one you want. </span></p>\n<p><span>At RateCity, you can compare interest and comparison rates, and also search for the personal loan features that are most important to you, so you can make the best decision when the time comes to make your choice.</span></p>\n<div class=""col-sm-8"" data-reactid=""3111"">\n<div class=""unset-body-text"" data-reactid=""3112"">\n<p><em>*The phrase&nbsp;&lsquo;some of the best&rsquo; is not a recommendation or rating of products.&nbsp;This page compares a range of personal&nbsp;loans from selected providers, not all products or providers are included in the comparison.&nbsp;No personal&nbsp;loan is one size fits all.

There are a number of options to take into consideration when you&rsquo;re comparing loans.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are fixed rate personal loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>As a customer, you have a wide choice when seeking your ideal type of personal loan &ndash; you can opt for the best variable rate or the <span>best fixed rate personal loans</span>. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) regulate the financial sector to ensure loan contract agreements are fair and transparent for you, the customer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use fixed rate personal loans from banks?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are several very good reasons why you might want to apply for a fixed rate personal loan:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the beginning of the loan period you will agree the amount you are borrowing, the period of time during which you will repay it and the amount of repayments, which will stay the same throughout the&nbsp;fixed term of the loan;</li>\n<li>Interest rates fluctuate and with a fixed rate personal loan you will avoid having to change your regular payments to reflect interest rate rises and falls;</li>\n<li>You can budget more exactly if you know there is a fixed amount of money leaving your account every month.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>How do I choose the best fixed rate personal loan for me?</strong></h3>\n<p>To identify the best fixed rate personal loan you will want to look first at the headline rate being advertised by the lender, and perhaps use a calculator to see what this will mean in terms of the level of your regular repayments. You will also want to check whether the lender requires the loan to be secured, for example on your home or other suitable asset, or whether the loan is being offered unsecured. If you have the capacity to secure a loan and are happy to do so this might provide more choices.</p>\n<p>The next feature is the fees charged by the lender. Are there upfront fees as well as ongoing fees, for example? Some lenders charge upfront fees only; some charge both and some charge neither. It&rsquo;s important to factor in any fees payable when you&rsquo;re looking at fixed interest rates. This includes missed payment fees, early exit fees and fees associated with redraw and extra repayment facilities. Again, a calculator will soon reveal the true cost of a loan and help you decide on your best option.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of fixed rate personal loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>When choosing a fixed rate personal loan, it's important to find one&nbsp;suitable for your borrowing purposes. For instance, you may be drawn to one which offers a good fixed rate of interest. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by a surprisingly low fixed interest rate, only to discover that there is a raft of fees applicable for setup, ongoing administration, extra repayments, missed payments, redraw facilities and early exit. Checking out the comparison rate of a loan is a good guide, however, it&rsquo;s still worth looking at any other add-ons.</p>\n<p>*&nbsp;<em>This page shows a sample of personal loans from RateCity's database, but does not compare all personal loans.

If you need a boat for business rather than just leisure, you can also find boat loans available for that purpose. These are personal loans and they work in the same way as loans for other purposes, such as buying a car or helping to fund a wedding.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use boat loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>People use boat loans when they want to make a marine purchase but don't have all the capital finance available. Boats can be expensive so it's no surprise that you may need some additional funds to acquire what you want. Because of the high value you may find that this type of personal loan will offer a larger amount for you to borrow and you could also benefit from longer repayment terms. Depending on what sort of loan you get you may also have to make a balloon payment when the loan term finishes.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of boat loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you decide to investigate a loan for your boat, you can look at secured or unsecured personal loans. If you choose a secured loan, one that has either the boat or another asset you own, such as a property or the boat itself, as collateral, you are more likely to be offered a lower interest rate. The lender has the guarantee that should there be a problem with repayments the boat or other asset could be sold to pay off the outstanding amount. If you negotiate for an unsecured loan, interest rates will in all probability be higher as the lender has no absolute guarantee of being paid back. It's also possible that the repayment time period will be less than for a secured loan and the amount you can borrow will not be as great.</p>\n<p>Repayment options can be with fixed or <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans/variable-rate"">variable interest rates</a></span> and you may be able to get a deal whereby you can pay off the boat loan early without incurring a penalty. Always read the small print of a loan agreement to see what fees and charges there may be.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of boat loans?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Boat loans are a useful way of getting the money you need for your purchase without having to wait until you have saved up enough. For an expensive boat that's not always an option so a personal loan that you budget carefully for can make the difference between owning a boat and not. On a variable interest rate bear in mind that your repayments may go up or down depending on movements in the financial markets, and that if you default on a secured loan you are in danger of losing the asset used as the guarantee.</p>",,5,114,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,57.5,262.0

It&rsquo;s a prosperous city, with higher average incomes and lower unemployment rates than the national average. House prices and rental costs are relatively high, pushing up the cost of living. However, Canberrans have access to a thriving financial sector when they need assistance with purchasing property or wish to take out personal loans.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>How do personal loans in Canberra work?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Financial institutions, including banks and non-bank lenders, offer a range of <span>personal loans in Canberra</span>, so there are plenty of options available. If you have a project you need to borrow money for, a personal loan may be the ideal solution, as they can be used for a variety of purposes.</p>\n<p>Your first step should be to check the policies of various lenders to identify those that will make suitable loans available to you. Next, compare the various features that suitable loans have, as well as any restrictions on them and extra charges that may be made.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use personal loans in Canberra?</strong></h3>\n<p>Canberrans apply for personal loans for specific purchases, such as buying a new car, motorbike or caravan, or to support students at university. Alternatively, they are sometimes used for large bills, unforeseen costs and large, one-off expenses, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consolidating debt;</li>\n<li>Medical treatment;</li>\n<li>Financial emergencies;</li>\n<li>Vital home repairs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>A basic personal loan consists of borrowing an amount on which your lender charges interest and then repaying it at regular intervals over an agreed period. Additional features can include other financial products, overpayment and redraw facilities, and a line of credit. It&rsquo;s still possible to get a personal loan from certain lenders if you&rsquo;re deemed a higher risk applicant because you have a poor credit rating or you&rsquo;re self-employed, for example.</p>\n<p>Linked products can include transaction accounts and credit cards. Your lender may also offer a feature that enables you to make occasional extra payments and redraw funds if you later find that you need them. Overpayment is one way of paying off your loan early, thus saving yourself money on interest rates, while a line of credit allows you to borrow what you need initially, and then start to repay it, but with the option of borrowing again, up to an agreed limit, should you need to.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of personal loans in Canberra?</strong></h3>\n<p>A personal loan can help you to make major purchases and pay unforeseen costs by providing extra funds. Terms and conditions can be flexible, and can be negotiated with lenders to better suit your circumstances.</p>\n<p>With a basic personal loan, there aren&rsquo;t usually any extra fees involved, but some lenders charge for extra features and place restrictions on how much and how often you can overpay or redraw. Make sure your personal loan repayments are affordable and always compare the features and options available to identify the best choice for your circumstances.</p>",,10,0,68,8,512,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,63.6,249.0

And by looking at the features and benefits offered by different lenders, you can work out which cheap personal loans can provide the greatest value for your money.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Fixed and variable interest rates</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>When taking out a cheap personal loan, the main cost involved is usually the extra interest you&rsquo;ll need to pay back to your lender, so it&rsquo;s usually worth looking for a personal loan with a low interest rate if possible. The next step is to work out whether you&rsquo;d prefer your personal loan to have a fixed or variable interest rate. </span></p>\n<p><span>A fixed interest rate is set by your lender at the start of your personal loan term, and remains the same for the duration of your loan. This keeps your repayments the same for the entire term of your personal loan, and if these are cheap enough for you to easily afford, then organising your monthly budget should stay nice and simple. </span></p>\n<p><span>A variable interest rate, on the other hand, may be adjusted by your lender over the term of your personal loan, to better suit the current economic conditions. It&rsquo;s possible that a rate cut could lower your repayments, providing you with an even cheaper deal on your personal loan. However, interest rate rises could make your initially cheap personal loan repayments much more expensive, so consider your options in relation to your financial situation. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Review Comparison Rates to find cheaper deals</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>You don&rsquo;t just pay interest on a personal loan &ndash; there are usually fees and charges involved as well, which can make a big difference to a loan&rsquo;s total cost. A low-interest personal loan with high fees may cost more overall than a higher-interest personal loan with cheaper fees and charges. </span></p>\n<p><span>One simple way to work out the approximate cost of different personal loans is to look at their Comparison Rates. This percentage figure combines a personal loan&rsquo;s advertised interest rate with its standard fees and charges, and can be used to help narrow down your shortlist of cheap personal loan options.</span></p>\n<p><span>Keep in mind that some personal loans may also include nonstandard fees and other costs that aren&rsquo;t included in its comparison rate. Also, to make sure you get great value from your personal loan as well as a cheap deal, check what extra features and benefits are offered by each lender.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Is it cheaper to pay off your personal loan early?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Short answer &ndash; yes, sometimes, though not always. </span></p>\n<p><span>Longer answer &ndash; Making extra repayments onto a personal loan can help bring you closer to making an early exit from the loan. By completing your personal loan repayments ahead of the scheduled term, you may be able to ultimately pay less total interest on your loan, for a cheaper deal overall. So far, so good.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, some lenders will charge fees for making extra loan repayments or an early exit from your loan, to make up for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on. These fees tend to be more common on fixed rate personal loans where you&rsquo;re expected to stick to a fixed repayment schedule, though they are sometimes present in variable rate loan deals too. It&rsquo;s usually worth checking your personal loan&rsquo;s terms and conditions, in case paying it off early ends up costing you more than you expected.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Redraw facility</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Does your cheap personal loan allow you to easily make extra repayments and get ahead on your loan? That&rsquo;s great! Why not take this opportunity to add your spare cash to your personal loan and get it paid off as quickly as possible?</span></p>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re concerned that this could possibly leave you short of spare cash for emergencies where you could really need it, it may be worth considering a personal loan that offers a redraw facility. When you get ahead in paying off one of these personal loans, the redraw facility will allow you to withdraw the surplus funds, subject to your lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions, so you can enjoy greater financial flexibility while bringing you closer to making an early exit from your personal loan. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Secured or unsecured personal loans?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you already own a car, or have equity in property, you may be able to guarantee your personal loan against the value of your asset. These secured personal often have lower interest rates due to their reduced lender risk, allowing you to enjoy cheaper loan repayments.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you don&rsquo;t have access to an asset with enough value to secure your personal loan, or if you&rsquo;d rather not risk potentially losing your asset if you&rsquo;re unable to make your loan repayments, there is the option of an unsecured personal loan. Because these loans tend to involve greater lender risk, they&rsquo;re more likely to have higher interest rates, resulting in more expensive repayments. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>100% loans</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>What if you want a personal loan, but don&rsquo;t quite have enough money saved up for a full deposit? </span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders offer personal loans with a high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), where you pay a smaller deposit up front, and borrow a greater percentage of your loan&rsquo;s total value. Some lenders even offer 100% loans, where you pay no deposit at all, and instead borrow the full total. </span></p>\n<p><span>Keep in mind though that lenders typically consider these loans to be higher risks, and may charge higher interest rates as a result. Look at your finances and work out whether it would be cheaper to save up for a deposit, or to make higher monthly repayments on your personal loan. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Debt consolidation</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re currently juggling repayments for multiple different debts, and struggling to manage their combined interest costs, taking out a personal loan to consolidate these debts could ultimately prove to be a cheaper option, as you&rsquo;d be paying just the one rate of interest. Plus, making just the one repayment per month can help make managing your budget so much easier. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, not every personal loan can be used for debt consolidation, so remember to check with the lender first. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare cheap personal loans</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>The cheapest personal loan isn&rsquo;t always the personal loan that provides you with the most value, so before making your final decision, it&rsquo;s worth comparing the personal loan offers from several different lenders at RateCity. </span></p>\n<p><span>Once you find a personal loan that costs you less money, while providing you with features and benefits that suit your financial situation, you&rsquo;ll be well on your way towards fulfilling those personal goals of yours.</span></p>\n<div class=""grey-lighter-background"" data-reactid=""1031"">\n<div class=""container"" data-reactid=""1032"">\n<div class=""unset-body-text"" data-reactid=""1033"">\n<div class=""copy-paste-block"">\n<div id=""guide"">\n<p><em>*The phrase&nbsp;&lsquo;some of the cheapest&rsquo; is not a recommendation or rating of products.&nbsp;This page compares a range of home loans from selected providers, not all products or providers are included in the comparison.&nbsp;No home loan is one size fits all.

If you&rsquo;re starting a business, it&rsquo;s worth comparing your products or services to those of the competition to see what you can do better. If you&rsquo;re buying a car, you should compare different models to work out which one will get you from A to B in style.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So when it comes to personal loans, which can be used to pay for any of these expenses, or to help you consolidate your existing debts, it also makes sense to compare the offers from different lenders. RateCity puts a wide variety of personal loan options in one place, so you can compare their interest rates and other benefits side by side and make an informed decision.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Compare personal loan interest rates</h3>\n<p>No matter your reason for taking out a personal loan, you&rsquo;re going to have to pay interest to your lender as well as paying back your balance. While comparing advertised interest rates is usually a good way to start your search for personal loans on RateCity, keep in mind that the personal loan with the lowest interest rate may not necessarily provide the cheapest deal, or the most value for your money.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many lenders charge fees as well as interest on their personal loans, which can make an impact on their overall cost to borrowers. A personal loan with a low advertised interest rate, but high fees and charges, may ultimately turn out to be a more expensive option than a personal loan with a higher interest rate and lower fees and charges.</p>\n<p>To get a more accurate picture of the relative costs of different personal loans, it&rsquo;s often worth also looking at their Comparison Rates, which combine their interest rates with their standard fees and charges.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that a personal loan&rsquo;s Comparison Rate may not take the lender&rsquo;s nonstandard fees into account, so you may want to double-check whether the loan could end up costing more than you expected. You may also want to find out which personal loans on your shortlist come with extra features that could offer additional value and influence your final decision.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Compare fixed and variable interest rates&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>If you opt for a fixed interest rate on your personal loan, you&rsquo;ll pay the same amount of interest with each repayment for the full term of your personal loan. Every repayment will bring you one step closer to getting your debt fully paid off, which can help to keep your household budget nice and simple. However, fixing your interest rate in advance could mean missing out on potential savings from interest rate cuts.</p>\n<p>If you choose a personal loan with a variable interest rate, then your lender may increase or decrease the amount of interest on your personal loan repayments each month.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s a rate cut, your repayments may drop, leaving you with some spare cash in your budget. However, if rates rise, you could find yourself coming up short, unless you do some careful budgeting in advance.</p>\n<p>Compare the benefits and drawbacks of fixed and variable interest rates to work out which option will best suit your financial situation.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Compare extra repayment/early exit fees</h3>\n<p>When you compare the cost of your personal loan&rsquo;s repayments to the available finances in your monthly budget, you may sometimes find yourself with some extra money to spare. This could be savings from an interest rate cut, some extra cash from a tax refund, or a bonus from work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While saving this money or using it elsewhere is certainly a valid option, you may also want to consider adding the extra money onto your personal loan. By making extra repayments, you can get closer to fully paying off your personal loan ahead of schedule, which can help to reduce the total amount of interest you pay overall.</p>\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind that some lenders charge fees for making extra repayments or for making an early exit from your personal loan, to help make up for the extra interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on. These fees are usually more common in fixed rate personal loans with pre-set repayment plans than in variable rate personal loans, which are often more flexible, though there are always exceptions. If you&rsquo;re hoping to pay off your personal loan ahead of schedule, it&rsquo;s worth comparing the available options for a lender with flexible terms.</p>\n<h3>Compare redraw facilities&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>If you choose a personal loan that allows you to easily get ahead on your repayments, it&rsquo;s often also worth comparing the available options to find a lender that also offers a Redraw Facility. Once you&rsquo;re ahead on your personal loan repayments, this redraw facility can be used to withdraw your surplus balance if required.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This can allow you to confidently make extra repayments onto your personal loan, knowing that you&rsquo;ll have the option to access this money again in case of emergency, subject to the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions.</p>\n<h3>Comparing debt consolidation options</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re already paying off multiple loans or other debts to a variety of lenders, and struggling to manage the numerous payments and interest charges, if you compare the available options, you may decide to consolidate these debts with the help of a personal loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By paying off your other debts with the money from a personal loan, you can swap your plethora of lenders for just the one, and make one simple, easy-to-budget repayment per month, and be charged interest just the once. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, not every personal loan can be used for debt consolidation, so it&rsquo;s worth comparing the available options from different lenders.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Comparing secured and unsecured personal loans</h3>\n<p>If you already own a car or another valuable asset, such as equity in a property, you may be able to enjoy a lower interest rate by opting for a secured personal loan. These loans guarantee the money that you borrow against the value of your asset, which can be seized by the lender if you don&rsquo;t stay up to date with your repayments. Secured personal loans can sometimes also be viable options for unemployed borrowers, or borrowers with bad credit, as the extra security helps to reduce risk to the lender.</p>\n<p>Unsecured personal loans are also available for borrowers who don&rsquo;t have access to a valuable asset, or for anyone who&rsquo;d prefer not to risk potentially losing their security. Because these loans tend to be riskier to lenders, you&rsquo;re more likely to be charged a higher interest rate as a result, so it&rsquo;s worth comparing the options that are available to you.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Comparing deposit options&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>How much money do you have saved up for a deposit on a personal loan? Even if the answer is &ldquo;not as much as you&rsquo;d like&rdquo;, there may still be options available.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some lenders can provide personal loans with a high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), where you pay a smaller upfront deposit and instead borrow a greater percentage of your loan&rsquo;s total. Some lenders can even offer 100% personal loans, where you pay no deposit and instead borrow the full loan balance.</p>\n<p>Remember when you compare these personal loan options that they may come with higher interest rates, due to the increased lender risk.</p>\n<h3>Compare personal loans at RateCity&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Do you know what you want from a personal loan, or do you want to learn more about the options that are available to you? Either way, you can find a variety of personal loans from a range of lenders right here at RateCity.</p>\n<p>By comparing the interest and comparison rates side by side, then taking a closer look at the features and benefits offered by different lenders, you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to finding a personal loan that&rsquo;s ideally suited to your personal finances.</p>",,5400,14,57,39,27310,0.6,0.125,0.125,0.75,0.75,24552.9,20.0

Being closer to Asia than any of the other major cities in Australia, Darwin and the Northern Territory have developed strong cultural, diplomatic and economic links with south-east Asia.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re living in or moving to Darwin, and need financial assistance, there are branches of all the major Australian banks in Darwin that offer personal loans, as well as many non-bank lenders.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>How do personal loans in Darwin work?</strong></h3>\n<p>These financial institutions offer a range of <span>personal loans in Darwin</span><span>,</span> so there are plenty of options available. Personal loans are more flexible than the likes of car loans and mortgages in that they can be used for a variety of purposes. When seeking support for a major purchase or debt consolidation, for example, your first step should be to check the policies of the lenders in Darwin to identify those that will offer loans that suit your circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use personal loans in Darwin?</strong></h3>\n<p>Darwin residents that are looking to take out a personal loan have myriad options when looking for the right lender. For example, you may wish to apply for a personal loan to make a major purchase, such as buying a new car, or to support a student at university. Alternatively, you may have bills you are struggling to pay. In the latter case, it&rsquo;s possible to take out a personal loan for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debt consolidation;</li>\n<li>Essential home repairs;</li>\n<li>Medical treatment;</li>\n<li>Unforeseen financial emergencies.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features?</strong></h3>\n<p>Your personal loan agreement may include the option to link your loan with additional financial products, such as current accounts, savings accounts and credit cards. If there&rsquo;s a specific feature you&rsquo;re keen to have, talk to your lender before you sign any agreement to check that it includes that feature and whether there are any extra costs involved.</p>\n<p>For instance, your lender may offer a facility to make occasional extra repayments, over and above the minimum agreed repayment level. They may also offer a redraw facility, which permits you to claw back overpaid funds if you discover you need them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is one way in which you can pay off your loan early, and save on interest rates. However, you need to check whether there are restrictions on how many overpayments and withdrawals you can make, and how often you can do so. You also need to check if the lender charges for these services.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of personal loans in Darwin?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Metropolitan life can be expensive, even in a smaller city such as Darwin, and if you&rsquo;re supporting a university student or a young family you may need to extra funds from time to time. A personal loan helps you to unlock the capital that can help you make major purchases and cope with unforeseen costs.</p>\n<p>As with any borrowing, it&rsquo;s important to make sure you can afford your personal loan repayments so you don&rsquo;t fall behind on them, which may cause financial problems for you or your family. Always compare the features and options of loans to make the best decision possible.&nbsp;</p>",,10,7,76,13,2596,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,277.45000000000005,165.0

Whether it&rsquo;s a small, temporary setback or a large, longer-term problem, the better your personal loan, the easier you&rsquo;ll find it to bring order to your finances and your life.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that you resist the temptation to sign up for the very first personal loan you come across. Instead, you should take the time to research any personal loan specials that are currently on the market, in the hopes of finding a better deal. Hopefully, you&rsquo;ll end up finding a product with a lower interest rate and/or lower fees.</p>\n<p>These specials might include interest rate reductions, fee reductions or some sort of an incentive gift, any of which might make the product significantly more attractive.</p>\n<p>The reason lenders sometimes unveil short-term deals is because the personal loan marketplace is incredibly competitive, with dozens of institutions fighting for your business. Lenders run these specials not because they want to do you a favour, but because they want to bring more customers through their doors. Of course, these specials need to be attractive to borrowers, otherwise nobody will take them up.</p>\n<p>So scroll up and have a look at the personal loans specials on this page. How do they compare do the offerings you&rsquo;ve already encountered?</p>\n<h3>Do a comparison search</h3>\n<p>Another thing you should do during your research is to use a <a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans"">personal loan comparison tool</a>, like the one provided by RateCity. This will allow you to quickly and easily compare more than 200 products, based on interest rates, fees and loan features.</p>\n<p>It might seem strange to look at regular loan offerings when there are specials available. However, sometimes one lender&rsquo;s regular offering is better than another lender&rsquo;s special. Also, some specials won&rsquo;t be applicable to every borrower.</p>\n<h3>Get the full picture</h3>\n<p>During your research, don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of assuming that interest rate is everything, for two main reasons.</p>\n<p>First, the advertised interest rate won&rsquo;t give you a full understanding of the costs involved. Why? Because it doesn&rsquo;t include fees. That&rsquo;s why you should also pay attention to the comparison rate, which does include fees and therefore represents the effective rate on the loan.</p>\n<p>(According to the industry standard, a comparison rate is calculated based on a loan of $30,000 over five years. So if your loan profile is different, the comparison rate will be slightly inaccurate.)</p>\n<p>Second, a personal loan&rsquo;s features can also be very important. For example, some loans allow you the flexibility of using a redraw facility, while others don&rsquo;t. Depending on your circumstances, a higher-rate loan with more features could be better than a lower-rate loan with fewer features.</p>\n<p>Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the interest rate isn&rsquo;t important &ndash; just that it has to be considered in the full context of the personal loan product you&rsquo;re researching.</p>\n<h3>Do you really need the loan?</h3>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished your research, take the time to think about whether you really need a personal loan.</p>\n<p>If, for example, you&rsquo;re in a debt hole, is taking out more debt going to make your situation better or worse?</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re currently struggling to find the money to meet your day-to-day expenses, will it become easier or harder once you&rsquo;re forced to make regular interest repayments?</p>\n<p>The key is to ask yourself why you feel compelled to consider a personal loan. Everybody&rsquo;s financial circumstances are unique, so blanket judgements are impossible. Sometimes, a personal loan is the best way to handle a particular life event; at other times, it isn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<h3>Personal loan alternatives</h3>\n<p>With that in mind, here are three possible alternatives to taking out a personal loan.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find ways to reduce your expenses. Examples include:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring your lunch to work instead of buying it</li>\n<li>Sell your car and use public transport</li>\n<li>Quit smoking</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t drink alcohol for three months</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t go out on the town for three months</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=""2"">\n<li>Find ways to increase your income. Examples include:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Get a second job</li>\n<li>Ask for extra shifts</li>\n<li>Become a pet-sitter</li>\n<li>Rent out a spare room through Airbnb</li>\n<li>Rent out empty cupboards through Spacer</li>\n<li>Rent out possessions through Spinlister</li>\n<li>Rent out clothing through Style Lend</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=""3"">\n<li>Borrow the money with your credit card &ndash; provided you&rsquo;re able to repay the entire debt during the interest-free period. If you do, you won&rsquo;t have to pay a cent of interest. But beware: if you don&rsquo;t repay the entire debt during this period, it could be extremely costly, because interest rates are usually higher for credit cards than personal loans.</li>\n</ol>",,30,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,3.0,453.0

If you find yourself paying off multiple credit cards, car loans, personal loans, or a combination of these, chances are you will be paying more on fees and interest charges than need be.</p>\n<p>This is where debt consolidation using a personal loan can come in handy. By taking out one loan, and rolling all your existing expenses into the one repayment, you will not only be simplifying your financial situation but reducing the amount of account keeping fees you are charged. Taking out a low interest rate personal loan can also help reduce the amount of interest you are charged on your debt and allow you to pay back the principal amount faster.</p>\n<p>Taking out a personal loan for debt consolidation is a proactive way of managing debt that can be incredibly useful for structuring and paying off debt in a set time frame.</p>\n<h3>Why use a personal loan for debt consolidation?</h3>\n<p><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161220085134/iStock-498973352-e1482187901214.jpg""><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""size-full wp-image-60917"" alt=""Student loan theme with textbooks and piggy bank and green chalkboard background"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161220085134/iStock-498973352-e1482187901214.jpg"" /></a></p>\n<p>There are many different reasons that a person may choose to take out a personal loan for debt consolidation. Some of the advantages include reducing the amount of fees you pay on your debt and the interest rate you are charged on the principal debt amount.</p>\n<p>Consolidating your debt can also make it easier to track by rolling your monthly repayments into one total repayment. This can help with budgeting if you are finding it difficult to keep on top of debt repayments. By having only one repayment to factor in, calculating your incoming and outgoing expenses should be greatly simplified.</p>\n<div class=""pros-cons"">\n<div class=""pros col-sm-6"">\n<div class=""pro-con-header"">\n<h5 class=""floating-title"">Pros</h5>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy all-in-one monthly repayment</li>\n<li>Less account keeping fees</li>\n<li>Potentially lower interest rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=""cons col-sm-6"">\n<div class=""pro-con-header"">\n<h5 class=""floating-title""><span class=""fa fa-thumbs-o-down""></span>Cons</h5>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>May not be the cheapest option available to you</li>\n<li>May be difficult to get approved if you have already defaulted on payments</li>\n<li>Paying debt off over a longer time period can mean you pay more in interest charges</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Borrowers who are looking to proactively get a hold of their financial situation before it gets unmanageable may want to consider using a personal loan for debt consolidation, especially if they want to avoid defaulting on a repayment. As consolidating debts into one repayment will usually bring with it a reduction in interest charges and fees per month, it can reduce the size of the overall repayments you make. This should help reduce the pressure on a tight financial situation.</p>\n<p>Another reason for using a personal loan for debt consolidation could be to take advantage of features that your current loan doesn&rsquo;t offer such as the ability to make unlimited extra repayments or to change the frequency with which you make repayments. Making repayments on a more frequent basis, such as weekly or fortnightly, can help reduce the amount you pay overall if the interest on your loan is compounded daily.</p>\n<h3>How can you consolidate your debts using a personal loan?</h3>\n<p>Depending on what kind of debts you have, the way in which you consolidate will be slightly different. For example, if you have multiple credit card debts and no existing personal loans then you would have to apply for a personal loan and then use the cash from the loan, once approved, to pay off the credit card debts. If, however, you have a personal loan, credit card debt and car loan and you&rsquo;re happy with the interest rate on your personal loan you could refinance your existing personal loan to consolidate them.</p>\n<p>The exact process is highly dependent on your individual circumstances and if you are unsure about what you should do, or if this is the best debt consolidation plan for you, it may be advisable to consult a financial counsellor. Particularly if the reason you are refinancing is because you find yourself drowning in debt, it could be a good idea to get some professional guidance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have a personal loan or car loan on a fixed rate you may have to pay some sort of break fee if you opt to consolidate that debt into a personal loan. The amount that you will have to pay will depend on your loan so you should investigate what fees will be associated with consolidating your debt before you apply for a new loan.</p>\n<div class=""breakout breakout-example"">\n<div class=""breakout-heading"">\n<p class=""breakout-title"">EXAMPLE - Bella rolls her debts into one</p>\n<p class=""breakout-title""><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161220084900/iStock-505095190-e1482187747771.jpg""><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""wp-image-60916 size-full"" alt=""Close up of a young woman sitting in kitchen and  going through her financials"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161220084900/iStock-505095190-e1482187747771.jpg"" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=""breakout-body"">\n<p>Bella has two credit cards, each with $2,000 debt and monthly repayments due at separate times. They both have interest rates upwards of 20 per cent. She also has $5,000 left on her car loan that she is paying off on a monthly basis with an interest rate of around 8 per cent. This makes a total of three separate repayments she is paying each month along with a total of $250 in annual fees between the cards and car loan. While she can afford all the repayments, Bella finds it hard to keep track of due dates and how she is tracking with paying off her debts.</p>\n<p>Bella has her sights set on a big overseas holiday but she wants to be debt free before she starts to save up. She decides that the easiest way to do this is to roll all of her debts into a personal loan so she can make one, reduced monthly repayment and control the time frame in which she repays the debt. She opts for a personal loan with an interest rate of around 10 per cent &ndash; half of what she&rsquo;s currently paying on her credit card debt.</p>\n<p>Once she is approved for the personal loan, Bella uses the cash to pay off the credit cards, thereby rolling them into the one loan. As her car loan doesn&rsquo;t allow unlimited extra repayments, Bella has to pay a small fee to pay out the loan and roll it into her new personal loan. While this does mean incurring an upfront cost, Bella calculates that the money she saves on the annual fee and by paying it off sooner will be worth it in the long run.</p>\n<p>Now, with all her debts rolled into one, Bella knows that she will be debt free by this time next year and then she can start saving up for her dream holiday.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Bad credit debt consolidation using personal loans</h3>\n<p>Consolidating debt using a personal loan may not be the most ideal solution for borrowers who have a bad credit rating and may have already defaulted on multiple repayments. It is unlikely that an application for a low rate personal loan from a borrower in this situation would be approved and this could further damage the applicant&rsquo;s credit score.</p>\n<p>For borrowers who find themselves already in a dire financial situation, it may be wise to seek financial counselling. A professional financial counsellor will be able to help you figure out an appropriate debt consolidation plan that may involve a debt agreement. A debt agreement is a form of bankruptcy and should not be entered into lightly as it will have ongoing implications on your financial situation.</p>\n<p>If you are struggling to make repayments on your loans you should contact your creditors immediately so that you can discuss a financial hardship plan. Any proactive approach you can take before you default on your loans will help in the long run.</p>\n<p>For more information on contacting a financial counsellor, visit the ASIC Money Smart website <a href=""https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/managing-your-money/managing-debts/financial-counselling"">here</a>.</p>",,320,3185,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1624.5,75.0

If you&rsquo;re not sure how useful or otherwise this could be, it&rsquo;s worth doing a little checking up before you commit to a specific loan arrangement.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are extra repayments?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>When you sign your loan agreement with your Australian lender of choice, you are pledging to repay your borrowing at a specific rate every week, fortnight or month, depending on your loan contract. The same applies if you have a credit card. Your lender sets the minimum amount you have to repay. However, at times you may have the option to pay a little bit extra if you are able to do so. This loan feature is called 'extra repayments'.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people make extra repayments?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are a number of reasons why you might want to make extra loan repayments.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you regularly pay even just a little bit extra on your loan you may discover that it can make a huge difference in the long run, and that your debt is paid off more quickly.&nbsp;This is because as you reduce the amount you owe you are also reducing the amount of interest that is calculated on the outstanding balance.</li>\n<li>If your chosen loan agreement allows you to make extra repayments without any additional penalty, doing so is likely to be of benefit to you at or before the end of the repayment period.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features?</strong></h3>\n<p>Lenders set a minimum loan repayment value based on charging you interest on the outstanding balance at each stage for the lifetime of your loan. So, often the largest portion of your early repayments will be to offset interest rather than repay the capital or principal you have borrowed. Making extra repayments provides you with an option to cover the required interest, repay some of the capital and then repay more of the capital because you are paying an additional amount.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each time you repay a little more of the capital amount you are effectively reducing the amount of interest the lender will be able to charge in the future. This means that the balance between interest and capital repaid changes in your favour during the loan period.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of extra repayments?</strong></h3>\n<p>Most lenders will provide you with a helpful calculator on their website that indicates the difference it can make to overpay loan amounts occasionally or regularly. Generally where an extra repayment feature is available there is an opportunity to overpay on loans at both fixed and variable rates, although always check with your lender if you have a fixed rate arrangement as some may charge additional fees for the privilege. Calculators can demonstrate how much interest you could save and how much time you could save in terms of the length of the repayment period.</p>\n<p>What you need to look out for is whether or not your lender will impose a penalty if you pay off your debt earlier than expected. This is important as if this is a significant amount it may not be worth making extra loan repayments.</p>",,5,2,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.5,490.0

Do you have a budget and a plan to pay back your loan once you&rsquo;re home from your dream honeymoon, or your new business is up and running, or your debts have been consolidated? Do you want simple and consistent monthly repayments to suit your budget, without surprises?</span></p>\n<p><span>If stability and security are among your financing priorities, then you may be interested in personal loans with fixed interest rates. By organising your loan repayments in advance, you&rsquo;ll know exactly what you&rsquo;re getting into when you sign on the dotted line, so you can enjoy piece of mind from your personal loan, in addition to its financial benefits! </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Benefits of a fixed rate personal loan</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>When it comes to fixed rate personal loans versus variable rate personal loans, fixed rate loans are typically the more consistent choice.&nbsp; Variable interest rates may rise or fall from month to month, and your monthly repayment amounts could also change with them, making preparing your household&rsquo;s monthly budget much more challenging. </span></p>\n<p><span>Having a fixed interest rate on your personal loan means that you&rsquo;ll always make the same repayments each month, regardless of the current economic conditions. This means you can be confident that each repayment will bring you one step closer to getting your personal loan fully paid off, without the risk of your interest rate potentially rising higher than you can easily afford.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Disadvantages of a fixed rate personal loan</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Agreeing to pay a fixed amount of interest on your personal loan usually also means agreeing to pay back your loan over a set length of time, without a lot of room for changes or adjustments to your repayment schedule. Even if you find yourself with extra money to spare, such as a bonus from work or a refund from the tax office, you may not be able to easily make extra repayments and get ahead on your personal loan repayments, nor may you be able to easily pay off your personal loan ahead of schedule. In fact, some lenders may charge fees for making extra repayments or paying off your personal loan early, to make up for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on if you were to make an early exit. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Redraw facility</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Even if your fixed rate personal loan offers the option of easily making extra repayments, you may be hesitant to sink your additional savings into your loan. Sure, you could get ahead on your repayments, but what if that leaves you without any spare funds available in case of emergency?</span></p>\n<p><span>If your personal loan also includes a Redraw Facility, when you get ahead on your repayments, you&rsquo;ll be able to withdraw your surplus cash when you need it, subject to the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. This adds some extra flexibility to your fixed rate personal loan, providing you with some options for managing your finances. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Comparison Rate</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re looking for a good deal on a fixed rate personal loan, it makes sense to start narrowing down your available options by looking at which lenders are offering the lowest interest rates &ndash; remember that these fixed interest rates should remain the same for the lifetime of the loan! However, once you take ongoing fees and other charges into account, low interest personal loans may not actually be the cheapest options available. Low interest personal loans with high fees may end up costing more in total than higher-interest personal loans with lower fees. </span></p>\n<p><span>To get a more accurate idea of a personal loan&rsquo;s total cost to you, consider its Comparison Rate, which is the approximate combined total of its advertised interest rate and its standard fees and charges. Not every cost associated with a loan is included in its comparison rate, so it&rsquo;s usually still worth looking further into the costs, features and benefits of each shortlisted loan option before making your final choice.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Debt Consolidation</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>One possible reason to consider taking out a fixed rate personal loan is to consolidate your debts. If juggling payments to a variety of different lenders is making your household budget overly complicated, it may be simpler to swap these out for a single personal loan repayment. And if you choose a personal loan with a fixed interest rate, you can simplify your budget even further, with consistent monthly repayments that bring you one step closer to being debt-free with every month. </span></p>\n<p><span>Remember though that not every personal loan can be used for debt consolidation, so be sure to check first. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Secured/Unsecured personal loans</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re looking at fixed rate personal loans because financial stability and security appeal to you, then you may also be interested in the option of a Secured personal loan, where the money you borrow is guaranteed against the value of an asset you own, such as a car, or equity in your home. This helps to reduce the lender&rsquo;s financial risk, which may allow you to enjoy lower interest rates. Also, if you&rsquo;re unemployed or have bad credit, secured personal loans can sometimes be viable options, depending on the lender and your financial situation. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you don&rsquo;t have an asset available with enough value to guarantee your personal loan, or if you&rsquo;d prefer not to risk losing your asset if you find yourself unable to make your personal loan repayments, there&rsquo;s also the option of an Unsecured personal loan. These loans are more likely to have higher interest rates than their secured counterparts, due to their increased lender risk, so consider which option will best suit your financial situation. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>100% loans</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Many lenders will require you to pay a deposit as security to qualify for a personal loan. But if you aren&rsquo;t currently able to afford a full deposit, what are your options?</span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders offer personal loans with a high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), where you pay a smaller deposit up front and borrow a greater percentage of your loan total. Some lenders also have 100% loans available, where you pay no deposit and instead borrow the full amount. These loan options are usually considered to be higher risks, with correspondingly high interest rates as a result. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare fixed rate personal loans</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Deciding whether you&rsquo;d prefer a fixed or variable interest rate should be among the first choices you make when choosing a personal loan. Once you know what to look for, you can compare a range of Australian personal loans, so your final choice can be an informed one.</span></p>\n<p><span>If a fixed rate personal loan is ticking all of your boxes, then go ahead and start comparing the offers available from different lenders right here at RateCity.</span></p>",,140,102,279,304,82541,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,8406.550000000001,39.0

Those who have maintained permanent employment over a long period of time are generally viewed as lower-risk applicants&mdash;having a regular stream of income means a borrower is more likely to meet regular repayment requirements. Casual employees who apply for personal loans could be viewed as higher-risk applicants, as irregular hours can lead to cash flow issues, meaning meeting payment requirements could be problematic at times.</p>\n<p>Though obtaining approval for a personal loan could be difficult for casual employees, this doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s an impossible feat. Some lenders do make exceptions for casual employees, while others may have personal loans tailored specifically for such applicants.</p>\n<h3>Who offers personal loans for casual employees?</h3>\n<p>Though casual employees could have a hard time getting a personal loan approved by a major bank or financial institution, many smaller banks and lenders will approval personal loans for casual employees who meet their eligibility criteria. Such criteria could include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A minimum age of 18</li>\n<li>A minimum yearly income, which would vary with each lender</li>\n<li>A minimum period of employment at current employer</li>\n<li>A good credit rating</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Interest rates&nbsp;for casual employees</h3>\n<p>As a casual employee would be considered a higher-risk borrower, personal loans for casual employees might attract a higher-than-usual interest rate.

These will vary with the lender, and could include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proof of identity such as a passport or driver&rsquo;s licence</li>\n<li>Proof of income such as recent pay slips and tax returns</li>\n<li>Proof of financial status such bank statements and credit card statements</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pros and cons of personal loans for casual employees</h3>\n<p>Having a personal loan approved will no doubt assist you to pay for that holiday, buy that car you need for your daily commute to work or get you the extra cash required for a personal project.

They are appropriate for many types of businesses, including partnerships and sole proprietorships. A fully drawn loan can be used for any purpose by a business, but the lender will carry out a due diligence examination of the potential borrower's financial circumstances to ensure there as few risks as possible in terms of the loan being repaid.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use fully drawn loans?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Running a business is a tough prospect and it's often the case that you don't have sufficient money at a particular time to buy essential equipment, such as new computers or vehicles. You may want to expand the business, so as well as needing more space, and the increase in cost that implies, you may also want to increase the number of employees you have. Taking out a fully drawn loan will enable you to develop your business in a way that increases your asset base and could provide more workers to expand productivity and thus become more profitable.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of fully drawn loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>This type of loan enables you to borrow a fixed amount of money according to your business needs. That money will be repaid on a regular basis, usually monthly, with a schedule predetermined by the lender that will then be agreed between you. It's often the case that you and the lender will work together so that loan payments are structured to suit your business's cash flow. Interest will be charged on the loan monthly or quarterly, though you may be able to negotiate semi-annual or even annual interest charges.</p>\n<p>A loan could also be interest only so that regular payments are smaller and the principal is repaid when the term of the loan ends. For this, a structure needs to be put into place to ensure there is sufficient money to pay off that principal sum.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of fully drawn loans?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Fully drawn loans offer businesses access to funds they may not be able to access in other ways. They can offer a significant boost to your business, and as an entrepreneur you are always likely to be seeking to expand. These types of loan are aimed at helping you do that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should always have a sound business plan to present to your lender and keep a keen eye on interest rates. If you take a fixed rate you get stable repayments, however, if interest rates go down you may want to renegotiate and that may involve a penalty for early repayment of an existing loan. If you go for a <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans/variable-rate"">variable rate</a></span> then repayments can go up or down depending on where market interest rates go, so you should weigh up whether you could relatively easily afford to pay higher instalments should that be necessary. A good budget should factor these variables in before you make a final decision.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

If you need extra funds to pay for a holiday, car, renovations or to consolidate your credit card debt, a short-term loan can be a fast way to access extra cash.</p>\n<p>Because you&rsquo;re borrowing money from a bank or lender, you&rsquo;ll need to meet certain eligibility criteria and income tests. If you&rsquo;re self-employed, don&rsquo;t have any assets or haven&rsquo;t quite managed to save a deposit, you might still be able to apply for a personal loan with the help of a guarantor.</p>\n<h3>What is a guarantor personal loan?</h3>\n<p>When you apply for a personal loan, the bank or lender will use criteria which will assist them in working out your ability to pay back the loan. Lenders will look at your income, credit history, employment and assets. If you don&rsquo;t meet one or some of these criteria and your personal loan application gets rejected, you could consider asking a family member or close friend to go guarantor.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t meet the asset or income criteria, you could be considered a risk in the eyes of the lender. By having a family member or friend act as a guarantor, they&rsquo;re essentially co-signing the loan and agreeing to accept responsibility for the repayments if you default. A guarantor essentially acts as a type of security, making your personal loan less risky to the bank or lender.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, having a guarantor on your personal loan might help lower your interest rate because the loan is less risky. A lower interest rate means that the loan will cost you less which could help you pay it off faster.</p>\n<h3>What is a guarantor?</h3>\n<p>To a certain degree, all types of personal loans are a risk to the lender. Borrowers that have a bad credit history, are self-employed contractors or have an irregular income can find it hard to get a personal loan. This is where a guarantor can help. A guarantor is a third party, usually a family member or close friend who agrees to take on the risk when you take out a personal loan. Put simply, a guarantor is someone who guarantees your personal loan using their own money or assets. Because a guarantor is wearing the risk, if the borrower can&rsquo;t make the repayments or defaults on the loan, the guarantor will assume financial responsibility for the money borrowed.</p>\n<p>There are a few advantages for the borrower in having a guarantor on their loan. The main one is that a guarantor can help you meet the criteria for a personal loan you&rsquo;d otherwise not be eligible for. The other potential upside is that because you&rsquo;ve got an extra guarantee on your personal loan, the lender may see you as a lower risk and give you a better interest rate.</p>\n<p>While it may feel like less responsibility for the borrower, having someone act as guarantor on a personal loan is a big responsibility, for both parties. Even if the borrower pays the loan back diligently, it will still appear on the guarantor's credit file which can affect their ability to secure credit cards and other loans in the future. Before you apply, it&rsquo;s important that you do your research and make sure you can afford to pay back your personal loan.</p>\n<h3>Types of guarantor personal loans</h3>\n<p>When it comes to personal loans, having the option of a guarantor is generally a feature and not a separate type of personal loan. When you apply for a personal loan, you&rsquo;ll have the option of choosing to have someone act as guarantor.</p>\n<p>There are two main types of guarantor personal loans on the market; secured and unsecured.</p>\n<h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans/guarantor"">Secured guarantor personal loans</a></h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to borrow funds and you don&rsquo;t have any assets, your guarantor can use their car, property, jewellery, boat or caravan as security against the personal loan. The upside of securing an asset to a personal loan is that you get access to funds you might not have been able to borrow. Because the guarantor is nominating a valuable item as collateral, the loan becomes less risky and the interest rate could go down. The potential downside is that if you default on your loan repayments, the lender can seize the asset to recoup the money you owe.</p>\n<h3><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans/guarantor"">Unsecured guarantor personal loans</a></h3>\n<p>If you opt for an unsecured guarantor personal loan, you or your guarantor are not required to secure an asset against the loan. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you can borrow money and never pay it back &ndash; there are serious implications for both you and your guarantor if you default on an unsecured personal loan. Unsecured guarantor personal loans tend to be riskier which means that they have a higher interest rate.</p>\n<p>Before you decide on a secured or unsecured personal loan, you should still do your research and compare the different types of guarantor personal loans on the market.</p>\n<h3>Who can go guarantor on a personal loan?</h3>\n<p>Depending on the size and type of personal loan, each lender has their own exact criteria over who can act as guarantor on a personal loan.</p>\n<p>While some lenders might restrict the role of guarantor to a borrower's parents or immediate guardian, other lenders might be a little more relaxed and accept other relatives, siblings or grandparents. Although quite unusual, there are some lenders who will accept friends and colleagues as guarantors, as long as you can prove the relationship is strong.</p>\n<p>Guarantors must meet the same lending criteria as other potential borrowers, specifically;</p>\n<p>A guarantor must be over 18 and be a citizen or permanent resident of Australia. They must have a good credit rating and be able to prove their income and employment. Because they&rsquo;re guaranteeing your personal loan, they must be able to show sufficient savings and have an asset they can put up as security against the personal loan.</p>\n<p>Every lender has their own set of eligibility criteria. Before you apply for a guarantor personal loan, it&rsquo;s important to compare the different loans, interest rates and options on the market.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Things you need to know as a guarantor</h3>\n<p>Acting as a guarantor on a loan can be a rewarding way to help a relative get ahead. But it&rsquo;s also a big financial responsibility. So before you agree to guarantee, make sure you understand exactly how liable you are.</p>\n<p>Consider how much you&rsquo;d have to pay in a worst-case scenario and how this could potentially impact your other commitments. Get an understanding of how secure the borrower&rsquo;s current income and employment are and assess the risk of them defaulting. It might be worthwhile getting your own legal and financial advice to make sure that going guarantor doesn&rsquo;t affect your ability to get a loan down the track. Financial and legal responsibilities aside, going guarantor can impact relationships if things don&rsquo;t work out.

With modest house prices, relative to the rest of Australia, the city is an attractive place in which to live and work, and should you find yourself in need of financial help, there are plenty of institutions that offer personal loans.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do personal loans in Hobart work?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>If you decide you want to take out a <span>personal loan in Hobart</span><span>,</span> you need to talk to local banks and other lenders. You may want to compare their terms and conditions online beforehand. Personal loans can be used for a variety of purposes, although while lenders will sanction borrowing to buy a car or pay medical bills, they may not agree to fund debt consolidation. Your first step should be to check the policies of lenders to identify those that will offer you a loan that suits your circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use personal loans in Hobart?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Hobartians use personal loans to meet major or additional expenses. It&rsquo;s possible to identify lenders who will offer you a loan even if you have poor credit history or are self-employed, you just need to shop around for the right deal. If you don&rsquo;t want to secure your loan on an asset, such as your car or home, you will need to look for lenders that offer unsecured loans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Personal loans can be used for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paying for a wedding;</li>\n<li>Making essential repairs to your home;</li>\n<li>Student funding;</li>\n<li>Dealing with financial emergencies, such as unexpected medical bills;</li>\n<li>Consolidating debt;</li>\n<li>Buying a new vehicle, such as a car, caravan or motorcycle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong style=""font-family: inherit;"">What are the main features?</strong></h3>\n<p>Personal loans have a number of features, but not all will be available from every lender. If you are seeking a degree of flexibility you may want a loan with overpayment and redraw facilities or a line of credit. Alternatively, you may want a loan that comes bundled with other financial products, such as a transaction account or credit card. It is, of course, possible to take out a basic, no-frills loan with a regular repayment schedule if that&rsquo;s what suits your needs.</p>\n<h3>How do I find the right personal loan?</h3>\n<p>A personal loan helps you to meet your financial commitments in a structured and affordable way. There&rsquo;s plenty of choice and, due to the competitive nature of the marketplace, you should be able to identify a lender and a product that provides the level of flexibility you require.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some lenders charge for extra features such as redraw and making additional payments, so it&rsquo;s best to check what fees and charges you could be liable for before signing any personal loan agreement. Investigating and comparing the details of personal loans at the outset is a must to ensure you choose the loan that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>",,10,0,8,7,267,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,29.950000000000003,305.0

If that's you then you need a holiday to get a bit of balance in your life. Sometimes an easily affordable weekend away in a nice hotel is all that's needed, but what if you want to take a couple or more weeks in an exotic destination but your day-to-day finances won't quite run to it?</p>\n<p>That's when some people&nbsp;consider <span>holiday loans</span> so they&nbsp;have the opportunity of taking that special trip. Maybe you want to explore your own country, taking a train journey across Australia or heading up to the Great Barrier Reef for some rest and relaxation; or a road trip across America, or a long visit to all those relatives in the UK or elsewhere that you've always meant to do.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use holiday loans?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Long-haul holidays can be expensive.&nbsp;When you add up all your household and living expenses and see what's left you might think you can&rsquo;t afford to splash out on a holiday. Making regular savings into a holiday account will help set you up, but if you're looking to finance a more expensive trip away a holiday loan can bridge the gap between what you've saved and what you need.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of holiday loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Holiday loans are personal loans and you should treat them like that. You're not buying a car, which would then be an asset, but an intangible product, so you should make clear to a lender why you want to borrow. As with all types of personal loan there will be many different financial products available, and your job is to <span>compare</span> as many as you can to get the right holiday loan deal for your purposes.</p>\n<p>Your ability to repay the loan will be scrutinised by lenders so you need to do your budgeting to make sure paying it off is feasible within the time period agreed. Look into variable and fixed rate interest deals to decide what suits best. With a fixed rate you know exactly how much you will repay each month; with a variable rate your payments could increase or decrease depending on the movement of the market interest rate.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of holiday loans?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Holiday loans can enable you to take the trip of a lifetime, though they are also useful for less expensive holidays where repayments may not take as long to complete. Examine interest rates every time &ndash; short-term loans will generally be more expensive in terms of the interest rate charged.&nbsp;</p>",,50,6,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,8.0,386.0

Not only will it increase the amount of equity in your property but it is also something you or your tenants can enjoy in the short term while you live in the property. Home improvements can range from large scale renovation projects to smaller DIY projects that increase the overall value of the home by making it more modern or functional.</p>\n<p>There are several different ways that you can fund a home improvement project if you do not wish or are unable to pay in cash. Different methods of funding your project will have different implications for how much the project will cost in total once the term of the loan and interest rates are factored in. These options include personal loans, credit cards and redrawing on your current mortgage.</p>\n<p>If you do decide to use a personal loan, then there are features you should be aware of before deciding on which loan is best for you. It is always wise to research different types of loans and compare some that you think may be good for you before settling on your final choice.</p>\n<h3>Why use a personal loan for home improvement?</h3>\n<p>It is often the case that people have to borrow money to pay for a home improvement because they don&rsquo;t have enough cash available. There are many different ways one can borrow money, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. One method of paying for your home improvement project is to take out a personal loan to cover the costs.</p>\n<p>The advantage of taking out a personal loan to complete your home renovation is that they often charge lower interest rates than credit cards, particularly if you take out a secured personal loan. This can help to keep the long term costs of borrowing money to a minimum.</p>\n<p>Using a personal loan also ensures that the amount of time spent paying back the loan will not stretch out and as a result increase the total amount of interest paid on the loan. This can be the case with redrawing funds from your home loan to use for a home improvement project. Even though you will be able to get a lower interest rate than with a standard secured personal loan, you run the risk of letting the loan amount be paid back over the term of your home loan which will significantly increase the total amount of interest paid.</p>\n<div class=""pros-cons"">\n<div class=""pros col-sm-6"">\n<div class=""pro-con-header"">\n<h5 class=""floating-title""><span class=""fa fa-thumbs-o-up""></span>Pros</h5>\n</div>\n<ul id=""pros-section"">\n<li>Lower interest rates than credit cards</li>\n<li>Flexible loan features available</li>\n<li>Fixed term to pay back loan</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=""cons col-sm-6"">\n<div class=""pro-con-header"">\n<h5 class=""floating-title""><span class=""fa fa-thumbs-o-down""></span>Cons</h5>\n</div>\n<ul id=""cons-section"">\n<li>Fees usually charged to set up and keep loan</li>\n<li>Generally charge higher interest rates than home loans</li>\n<li>Not all personal loans will be flexible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Features of a personal loan</h3>\n<p>Some features of a personal loan that you should be aware of before you use one to fund a home improvement include secured/unsecured loans, interest rates, fees and the ability to make extra repayments. Finding the right combination of these features will result in a loan that is suited to your personal financial situation and the requirements that come with it.</p>\n<p>A secured personal loan is a loan where you offer up an asset as security that the bank will sell if you fail to make the payments on your loan. As there is an added layer of security for the bank, these loans offer lower interest rates than unsecured personal loans.</p>\n<p>Personal loan interest rates come in both fixed and variable forms. Fixed loans will have one interest rate that keeps your monthly repayment amount steady over the loan term. Variable personal loans generally have a lower interest rate than fixed loans but will be subject to rate rises according to market conditions. Deciding between the two may depend on if you require your monthly repayment amount to be consistent and how much room there is in your budget for fluctuation.</p>\n<p>Personal loans will also charge varying fees that you should be aware of before you sign on to the loan. These could include upfront fees as well as ongoing fees. It is necessary to ask your potential lender for a summary of all the costs involved in taking out the loan you are interested in before you commit to anything.</p>\n<p>Other available features of a personal loan include the ability to make extra repayments and pay off the loan early. Finding a loan that allows you to do both of these things will give you more control over how long you have the loan for and how much you repay in interest by the end of the loan. You will find that the faster you can pay down the loan the more you will save over time. You can investigate different loan terms, and the amount of interest you will pay with these loan terms, using a personal loans calculator.</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Calculate</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">Personal Loan Calculator</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans/calculator"">Calculate Now</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>How you can use a personal loan to add value to your home &nbsp;</h3>\n<p><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161207143642/iStock-501574788-e1481085409860.jpg""><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""size-full wp-image-60114"" alt=""Porcelain freestanding bath in designed white bathroom"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161207143642/iStock-501574788-e1481085409860.jpg"" /></a></p>\n<p>Using a personal loan to complete a home improvement project can be a good way to increase the value of your home and in turn increase the useable equity. The equity in your property depends on the market value of your home, so by updating a kitchen or adding an outdoor area you could potentially be upping your property&rsquo;s resale value.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that not all home improvements will add value to your home. If this is your primary goal, then you should research what improvement is most likely to make your home more attractive to buyers. It is generally acknowledged that installing a modern, functional kitchen or bathroom space is a great way to add value to an older property.</p>\n<p>More superficial home improvements can also add to the value of your home without being too expensive or disrupting your living arrangements if you currently reside in the property. Things like replacing old carpet in bedrooms or adding a coat of paint to the exterior of your home will assist in adding value to your home.</p>\n<p>As you will be putting yourself into debt to make these home improvements it is most likely desirable that you will be getting some sort of return on your investment. While this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be monetary return, if you can avoid damaging the value of your property then this is advisable.</p>\n<h3>Home improvements that won&rsquo;t add value to your home</h3>\n<p><a href=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161207143935/iStock-91781192-e1481085582462.jpg""><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""size-full wp-image-60115"" alt=""swimming-pool in a backyard"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20161207143935/iStock-91781192-e1481085582462.jpg"" /></a></p>\n<p>Not all home improvements will be worth borrowing money for in the form of a personal loan. Some may actually decrease the value of your home making the upgrade less of an investment. If you want to go ahead with the project anyway, because it is something you will enjoy in your everyday life, then that&rsquo;s fine but for as an investment you should beware that it may not have the desired effect.</p>\n<p>Some home &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; that could fall into this category include a swimming pool and complex outdoor landscaping. Potential buyers may see these additions as difficult to maintain and hard to remove if they desire. This will then potentially reduce the value of your home.</p>\n<p>Other renovations that will potentially have an adverse effect on the value of your home include painting the walls dramatic colours or adding obscure fixtures and fittings that may not be to everyone&rsquo;s taste. Especially in an investment property that is being used as a rental, keeping the home as neutral as possible will make sure that it appeals to the widest amount of potential renters.</p>\n<p>Another good rule of thumb is to not complete renovations that will end up costing more than around 5 per cent of the property value as it is unlikely that you will get much more than this back from the home improvement. If you are going to take out a personal loan, and put yourself further in debt, to make these changes to your home then it is wise to make sure you are not overstretching yourself for no foreseeable return.</p>",,10,10,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,6.0,404.0

Instead you can use part of the loan to fund a specific project and even as you continue to repay that sum you can redraw funds for another project within the line of credit limit.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use a line of credit personal loan?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are several reasons why you might want to apply for a line of credit personal loan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You might like the idea of having a financial safety net in case you incur unexpected expenditure, such as a medical bill or repairs to your home or car;</li>\n<li>You might want to link your line of credit personal loan with your savings or your everyday account, making it easier to manage your funds;</li>\n<li>You might want to act as guarantor for a family member without having to dip into your savings, or to help support a child planning to study at an Australian university.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>Individual line of credit personal loans have different features, so it&rsquo;s always best to make enquiries about whether the lender offers competitive rates and how easy it will be to access your funds, for example via phone or internet banking and at ATMs. In most cases, you will pay an establishment fee, however, only a few lenders will ask for a monthly service fee as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A line of credit personal loan may be secured or unsecured, depending on the amount you want to borrow and the lender&rsquo;s rules and regulations. For example, you could secure your loan on your property or even your car, if it is not too old and you are not borrowing more than its market value.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of line of credit personal loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>A line of credit personal loan offers access to funds, as you need them. This means you can withdraw additional funds, should they be required. One key benefit is that you will only pay interest on the total sum you have withdrawn at any one time rather than the total amount you could borrow. Another benefit is that you don&rsquo;t have to keep reapplying when you need more money, as you can simply redraw within the agreed credit limit.

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Personal Loans that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p>When you apply for a personal loan, you&rsquo;ll need to meet certain eligibility criteria and prove to the lender that you can afford to pay back the loan. If you&rsquo;re self-employed or have a limited financial history, meeting some of the asset and income criteria can be challenging, especially when it comes to producing payslips. A low-document or low-doc personal loan gives you access to funds without the usual lengthy loan application paperwork.</p>\n<p>When you apply for a low-doc personal loan, the lender will assess your credit history and, if you&rsquo;re self-employed, they&rsquo;ll look at how long you&rsquo;ve been in business. Depending on the lender and your circumstances, a letter from your accountant may help you get around providing conventional proof of income. Low-doc personal loans can either be secured by an asset like a car or home or be unsecured. There are plenty of low-doc loans on the market, so before you make a decision, it always pays to compare your options.</p>\n<h3>How do low-doc personal loans work?</h3>\n<p>Low-doc personal loans work the same way as more traditional personal loans. You enter into an agreement with a lender to borrow an amount of money which you pay back in monthly, fortnightly or weekly repayments. The main difference between a low-doc and a standard personal loan is the amount of documentation required to prove your income. With a low-doc loan, you don&rsquo;t need to provide as much documentation and proof of income like payslips or tax returns.</p>\n<p>From the lender&rsquo;s perspective, low-doc loans are generally riskier because, in most cases, the borrower can&rsquo;t prove that they&rsquo;ve got a regular income. To counter the risk, the interest rates on low-doc loans may be higher than other secured or unsecured personal loans. Much like traditional personal loans, a low-doc personal loan can be secured to property or other assets like a car or jewelry or can be unsecured.</p>\n<p>Because you usually have discretion over how the funds are used, people apply for low-doc loans for all sorts of reasons. It could be to get a business idea off the ground or to fund a big-ticket purchase like a holiday, boat or caravan. You could also use a low-doc personal loan to pay medical bills or fund small renovations.</p>\n<p>Given that there&rsquo;s usually less paperwork involved, applying for a low-doc loan is generally a relatively simple process.</p>\n<h3>How do I apply for a low-doc personal loan?</h3>\n<p>Applying for a low-doc loan is a lot less hassle than applying for a traditional personal loan. Once you&rsquo;ve compared the various low-doc loans on the market and you&rsquo;ve decided on a loan that suits your needs, the actual application process is quite simple.</p>\n<p>Depending on the lender, you may need to provide some of the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you&rsquo;re self-employed, you might need to supply details such as your ABN and/or Certificate of Incorporation</li>\n<li>Your business activity statements for the past 12 months which have been verified by the Australian Tax Office (ATO)</li>\n<li>Confirm that your income has been registered for GST for at least 12 months</li>\n<li>Show the last two years of your full personal and/or company tax returns to prove your income</li>\n<li>Show profit/loss statements</li>\n<li>Recent bank statement detailing your savings and business transactions.</li>\n<li>Depending on the lender, you&rsquo;ll need to provide an Australian driver&rsquo;s licence or passport to verify your identity</li>\n<li>Lender may ask for a letter from your accountant</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because each lender has their own requirements, some lenders may simply ask you to sign a statement confirming your ability to make repayments.</p>\n<p>While low-doc loans can be appealing given their convenience and ease, they should really only be used for people who don&rsquo;t meet the eligibility criteria. For all their positives, low-doc loans do pose an extra risk for the lender, which in turn means they generally have higher fees and interest rates.</p>\n<h3>Things to consider before applying for a low-doc personal loan</h3>\n<p>Low-doc personal loans are a lot easier to apply for than traditional personal loans. This may create the impression that borrowing money is easy and you may be tempted to borrow more than you can afford to repay. You should really only apply for a low-doc loan as a last resort and, regardless of the amount you borrow, always be sure that you can pay back the loan.</p>\n<p>When comparing types of low-doc personal loans, don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;ll have to pay interest on the amount you borrow. If your interest rate is 12 percent, for every $1 you borrow, you&rsquo;ll have to pay back $1.12. It might not seem like a lot to add to one dollar, but it all adds up and compounds quickly.</p>\n<p>Because this type of loan requires less documentation and proof of income, you may find that that low-doc personal loans don&rsquo;t have as many features as other types of personal loans.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a quick and easy loan, a low-doc personal loan can be a useful solution. Before you lock yourself into a low-doc loan, it&rsquo;s important that you consider all your options and make sure you can afford to make the repayments. If you don&rsquo;t have a stable income and you&rsquo;re under financial stress, a low-doc personal loan may put you into more debt.</p>\n<p>Not paying back your low-doc personal loan can have some serious implications and cost you extra in late payment fees. Before you decide on the amount you want to borrow, make sure you plan how you&rsquo;re going to make your repayments and whether you can actually afford to pay both the principle and the interest back.</p>\n<p>Like any other type of personal loan, pay close attention to the interest rate. When you&rsquo;re comparing low-doc personal loans, look out for both the advertised rate and the comparison rate. The advertised rate is the cost of the loan without any of the fees, whereas the comparison rate includes all the additional charges and gives you a more realistic cost of borrowing the money.</p>\n<h3>Are there advantages to low-doc personal loans?</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re self-employed or have a limited financial history, there are some advantages to a low-doc personal loan. The main advantage is that they can be easier to apply for because you don&rsquo;t need as much documentation to prove your income. Because there&rsquo;s less paperwork, a lot of low-doc loans have a quicker turnaround time.</p>\n<p>Low-doc personal loans tend to have higher interest rates and fees, making them less advantageous in certain circumstances. If you&rsquo;re looking to use the loan to buy a car, you might be better off opting for a secured personal loan and taking advantage of a lower interest rate.

One of the most obvious factors to keep in mind is the interest rate on your personal loan &ndash; generally, the lower the better!</p>\n<p>When comparing low interest personal loans at RateCity, the interest rate is just one of many personal loan features to consider when making your borrowing decision.</p>\n<h3>Variable vs fixed rate personal loans</h3>\n<p>Fixed rate personal loans are great if you want to prepare your budget in advance, as they allow you to always pay the same amount of money with each monthly repayment, with no surprises or adjustments. If your fixed interest rate is a low one, you can be confident that you should always be able to afford it! However, if your interest rate is fixed in advance, it won&rsquo;t get any lower if your lender starts making rate cuts. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you instead opt for a personal loan with a variable interest rate, the amount of interest you pay&nbsp; on your loan each month could drop if the lender passes on a rate cut, allowing you to save a little money. However, it&rsquo;s also possible that the interest rate could rise, which could be bad news for your bank account if you haven&rsquo;t budgeted for higher repayments.</p>\n<h3>Secured vs unsecured personal loans</h3>\n<p>Securing your low rate personal loan against the value of an asset, such as a car or equity in a property, is usually seen by lenders to be a far less risky prospect than the alternative. After all, if for any reason you were to default on your personal loan, the lender could simply seize and sell your asset and keep their interests covered! Of course, to take out one of these secured low interest personal loans, you&rsquo;ll need to already own an asset with enough value that your lender can be confident it would&nbsp;guarantee your loan.</p>\n<p>Unsecured personal loans don&rsquo;t put you at risk of potentially losing any assets, so they can be convenient if you don&rsquo;t own a high-value item, or if the value of the assets you do own won&rsquo;t be enough to cover your loan. However your lender is more likely to charge a higher interest rate on an unsecured personal loan to account for the added risk.</p>\n<h3>Comparison Rates</h3>\n<p>Looking for a personal loan with a low interest rate is all well and good, but what about the extra fees and charges? A low-interest personal loan with a high application fee and ongoing charges may ultimately turn out to be more expensive than a higher-interest personal loan with lower ongoing costs.</p>\n<p>To get a better idea of the total cost of a low rate personal loan, it&rsquo;s worth looking at its Comparison Rate. This percentage figure combines the approximate total of the loan&rsquo;s advertised interest rate and its standard fees and charges, giving you a more accurate guideline of which loans may be better suited to your financial situation.</p>\n<p>However, a low interest personal loan&rsquo;s comparison rate may not take into account any nonstandard fees or other costs, or any extra features and benefits the lender offers that could affect your decision. Comparison Rates can be helpful for narrowing down your choice of personal loan providers, but it&rsquo;s still worth taking a closer look at the available options before making your final decision.</p>\n<h3>Debt Consolidation</h3>\n<p>Are you currently paying off a variety of debts from a range of sources, all on different schedules and at different interest rates? Juggling all of these repayments can be tricky to manage, not to mention rough on your finances!</p>\n<p>One relatively simple option for managing&nbsp;your various debts is to take out a personal loan for debt consolidation. By using this personal loan to pay off your other debts, you&rsquo;ll be left with just the one one monthly repayment to budget for. If you&rsquo;re careful and conscientious, you can find yourself debt-free much faster than you may have expected.</p>\n<p>When you're looking for the bes debt consolidation personal loans in Australia, keep in mind that some lenders may not allow all of their personal loan offers to be used for debt consolidation, so be sure to check the terms and conditions.</p>\n<h3>Early exit/extra repayments</h3>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re paying back a personal loan with a low interest rate, from time to time you may find yourself in a position where you can afford to pay back a bit extra. Getting ahead on your personal loan repayments can bring you closer to paying your loan off ahead of schedule, which can mean ultimately paying less total interest over the lifetime of the loan.</p>\n<p>However, some lenders charge fees for making extra repayments or exiting a low rate personal loan early, to make up for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on. Be sure to check whether getting out of debt with your lender won&rsquo;t accidentally cost you more than you expected!</p>\n<h3>Redraw facility</h3>\n<p>Ever wished you could free up some of the extra money you&rsquo;d paid towards getting ahead on a low rate personal&nbsp;loan so you put it to use elsewhere? Some low interest personal loans offer a redraw facility, which lets&nbsp;you do just that.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re ahead on your personal loan repayments, a redraw facility can be used to withdraw your surplus funds when you need them, subject to the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. The added flexibility offered by a redraw facility can help you get ahead on your personal loan repayments with confidence, knowing that even if a financial emergency was to arise, your extra cash won&rsquo;t remain tied&nbsp;up <span>and inaccessible</span>&nbsp;in your loan. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>100% loan</h3>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of cash saved up in your bank account, paying a full deposit on a low interest personal loan could be a challenge.</p>\n<p>If you choose a personal loan with a high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR), you can pay a smaller deposit up-front, and borrow a higher percentage instead. Some lenders also offer 100% loans, where you pay no deposit, and borrow the full amount instead.</p>\n<p>Just remember that these loans represent higher risks to their lenders, so they tend to come with higher interest rates. You may want to consider whether it would be better for your finances to make these higher repayments, or to save up a deposit and hopefully enjoy a personal loan with low interest.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Compare low interest personal loans</h3>\n<p>A low interest personal loan could potentially save you pockets full of cash, and by comparing the additional features and benefits offered by different lenders, you can find a deal that&rsquo;s perfect for your financial situation.</p>\n<p>Start your financial journey by comparing low interest personal loans at RateCity &ndash; before you know it, you could have the money you need to make your dreams come true.</p>",,1900,3493,9133,9500,471828,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,51914.25,10.0

None of us wants to undergo medical treatment if we can avoid it, and a healthy lifestyle can contribute to keeping the doctor away. Yet there are times when you have to undergo medical procedures and your health insurance or the public system may not cover all the costs of treatment.</p>\n<p>Medical bill loans could make the difference between having the treatment you need when it's really necessary. Being in a road accident, for example, may lead to prolonged health care with operations and recuperation and it doesn't help your recovery if you're worried about how to pay for everything. So considering a personal loan for your medical bill is an option&nbsp;some people explore.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use medical bill loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Healthcare insurance doesn't always cover you for all your medical needs at a particular time, and you should always check to see exactly what you are entitled to. You'll be covered for many things but depending on your age and medical history there may be some things that aren't covered. Dental treatment, for example, can be expensive and if you have an emergency problem or need some long-term root canal work you may have to make a significant contribution to the cost. This is where a medical bill loan can help take the financial pressure off so that you can have the treatment you need and pay back the loan over a period of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may also need it for longer-term hospital bills or for post-accident cosmetic surgery, though even if cosmetic surgery is not deemed to be medically necessary there's no reason not to explore your options for financing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of medical bill loans?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Lenders will always look at requests for medical bill loans and may well be empathetic, though that won't stop them looking to get the best deal they can. You need to be aware that they will be enabling a personal loan for a specific requirement, so you need to be very clear about the costs you will be incurring and the means you have to pay back a medical bill loan. Check interest rates and fees when you make loan comparisons. Borrowing larger amounts may give you a better interest rate than a small short-term loan, though if that's what you need then consider making an application.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of medical bill loans?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>This type of loan could well be essential to preserve your health and there's not much more important than having good health. A medical bill loan can take away much of the financial worry and actually be beneficial in the state of mind needed to recuperate quickly or to get essential procedures carried out quickly.</p>\n<p>Make sure you can afford the regular repayments and try to search out a loan that will not charge you interest over the comparable odds.</p>",,5,3,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2.0,473.5

Strong employment growth across several sectors has made the city increasingly prosperous, and two of the big four banks in Australia have their headquarters in the city. So, if you&rsquo;re looking for a personal loan in Melbourne you can rest assured the financial sector means you&rsquo;ll have plenty of options to choose from.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do personal loans in Melbourne work?</strong></h3>\n<p>Financial institutions offer a range of <span>personal loans in Melbourne</span> so there is plenty of choice if you&rsquo;re looking to borrow money. Personal loans are more flexible than home loans, in that they can be used for a variety of purposes. When seeking support for a major purchase or debt consolidation, for example, your first step should be to check the policies of the various lenders to identify those willing to offer you suitable loans.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use personal loans in Melbourne?</strong></h3>\n<p>Melburnians have plenty of options when it comes to choosing the right lender for a personal loan, and residents of the second most-populous city in Australia commonly use personal loans for the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying a new car;</li>\n<li>Consolidating debt;</li>\n<li>Unforeseen financial emergencies;</li>\n<li>Making essential home repairs;</li>\n<li>Paying unexpected medical bills;</li>\n<li>Supporting a student.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features?</strong></h3>\n<p>Your personal loan agreement may include several optional extras, such as linking your loan with other financial products like credit cards, transaction accounts and savings accounts. Personal loan features will differ from lender to lender, so ask if any specific facilities you wish to be included in your loan are available.</p>\n<p>For example, in some cases you can make extra repayments, over and above the minimum repayment amount set by your lender, allowing you to pay off the loan more quickly, thereby saving yourself money in terms of interest. Often linked to this is a redraw facility, allowing you to reclaim some of your overpayments if required. However, you need to check with each lender you&rsquo;re considering if they place any restrictions on overpayments and reclaiming, and if they charge you extra for doing either.</p>\n<p>Some lenders will sanction a personal loan for purposes such as paying medical bills, but will reject applications for intents such as debt consolidation. It is always best to check your lender&rsquo;s policies before making an application to ensure you&rsquo;re not wasting your time.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of personal loans in Melbourne?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>City life can be expensive, especially if you have a growing family or you are supporting a college student, and sometimes you need a little extra money due to unforeseen circumstances. A personal loan offers you the opportunity to get the help you need to cope.</p>\n<p>Always make sure your personal loan repayments are affordable, because if you miss them you will get into debt, which may then cause cashflow problems for you or your family. By comparing all the options available, and all the features of any loans you&rsquo;re considering, you will be able to make a sound decision.</p>",,110,3,8,4,245,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,38.8,287.0

For example, you may need to pay an application fee, fees for security documentation or account-keeping each month, and penalties for paying your loan off early. All these should be flagged up in a lender's information about every type of loan they offer. If you are looking to reduce the amount of costs you are paying it&nbsp;may be worth searching for <span>no document release personal loans</span>.

When you are searching for the best possible deal for you it&rsquo;s important to remember to look into the issue of early exit penalties.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What is an early exit penalty?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In 2010 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) consulted widely within the financial sector about the practice of charging borrowers an extra fee if they repay a loan early. For example, if you have a home or personal loan at a fixed or variable rate of interest, and you wish to repay the loan in full before the end of the agreed borrowing period, some lenders will charge you an additional fee, while others will not. Obviously you, the customer, stand to benefit if you go with a lender with <span>no early exit penalty</span> fees.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Why look for a loan with no early exit penalty?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>There are a number of reasons why you might want to choose a loan with no early exit penalty:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you can afford to make extra payments at least a few times every year, and your lender does not restrict the amount you repay or the frequency, you might repay your loan early;</li>\n<li>Your extra payments will reduce the amount of debt you have and this in turn will reduce the interest you&rsquo;re paying;</li>\n<li>ASIC now enforces laws on exit fees to protect borrowers: lenders are limited to recouping their actual losses only and may not overcharge for early repayment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features?</strong></h3>\n<p>Not all lenders use the same terminology in their loan contracts, which can be confusing for their customers. As well as an early exit fee or penalty, the other terms to look out for when you read the small print are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>early redemption fee;</li>\n<li>early repayment charge or penalty;</li>\n<li>financial penalty;</li>\n<li>redemption charge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where fees are applicable they can vary, although in many&nbsp;cases they will be equivalent to one or two months interest. Better to seek out a lender offering no extra charges instead, so that you won&rsquo;t have to pay the additional interest. This won&rsquo;t necessarily cost you more, and some of the cheapest available loans have a no early exit penalty policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of a loan with no early exit penalty?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>The benefits to customers who want to repay a debt quickly are easily understood. If you know that quicker repayment will not cost you more, then you have a powerful incentive to discharge your debt as fast as you are able.</p>\n<p>Lenders are competing to make their products the most attractive in the market, which is why it&rsquo;s possible to spot attractive packages with no establishment fees and no monthly charges, as well as no early exit fees.</p>\n<p>If you think it unlikely you will be in a position to repay your loan early, then whether or not your lender charges early exit fees is probably not relevant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Always check the terms and conditions of your loan contract for specific information about early exit penalties.</p>",5,74,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,37.5,290.0

When you are searching for the best possible deal it&rsquo;s important to remember to look at ongoing fees payable monthly, as well as establishment and settlement fees.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are monthly ongoing fees?</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to a fee for setting up your loan, some lenders also make monthly charges for administration. This means that the total monthly outgoings for your loan are likely to be part interest repayment, part capital repayment and part administration charge. A loan arrangement with <span>no monthly ongoing fees</span> is one that will mean you are still repaying interest and capital, but not administration charges.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Why look for a loan with no monthly ongoing fees?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are a number of reasons why you might want to choose a loan with no monthly ongoing fees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&rsquo;s a cheaper option to select a loan where no ongoing monthly fees are due;</li>\n<li>It helps your personal cash flow if you don&rsquo;t have to factor in monthly administration charges on top of your loan repayments.</li>\n<li>Not having to pay monthly charges may mean that you can afford to overpay your loan every now and again;</li>\n<li>Such extra payments will serve to reduce the amount of debt you have and this in turn will reduce the interest you&rsquo;re paying.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features?</strong></h3>\n<p>Lenders that charge monthly ongoing fees must advertise the fact when setting out the details of the products they are offering. Some lenders ask for a one off setup fee, but then waive any ongoing charges. Other lenders will waive the setup fee but then charge you ongoing monthly fees for the period of the loan. If you do a quick calculation when comparing loans for the same amount over the same period you can usually tell which is the better deal.</p>\n<p>Loans with no ongoing fees have become more and more popular in Australia, although many of these do not offer the same kind of features as others and sometimes the interest rate is slightly higher. For example, you may not be able to link an offset account to a loan with no ongoing fees, which could be a disadvantage for some people.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of a loan with no monthly ongoing fees?</strong></h3>\n<p>The chief benefit is that you&rsquo;re paying less each month and everything you are paying is paying down your borrowings. There&rsquo;s also the advantage of perhaps being able to afford occasional extra payments to reduce your debt quickly. Always ensure the lender won&rsquo;t charge you for overpaying before you select this option.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remember: Australian lenders are always competing to make their products the most attractive, which is why it&rsquo;s possible to spot loan packages with no establishment fees, no early exit fees and no monthly ongoing charges.

All this is good news for you, the customer, as you have increased choice when seeking a personal loan. Often <span>non-bank lenders&rsquo; personal loans</span> offer an excellent alternative to banking institutions.

Check if you can make interest only payments if this is attractive to you and whether there are rules applying to the purpose of your personal loan. Some non-bank lenders offer redraw facilities however they may charge you for this.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of non-bank lenders&rsquo; personal loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Undoubtedly applying for a non-bank lender personal loan is useful for you as a customer, as you will generally have a better, more flexible and personalised customer service if you are with a smaller institution.

Its vibrant economy has seen employment grow in areas such as public administration and business services, as well as community and personal services, education, health, retail and wholesale trade.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As such, there are many banks and non-bank lenders that offer personal loans in Perth, which means you should have plenty of options when it comes to getting a good deal.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do personal loans in Perth work?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you want to apply for a <span>personal loan in Perth</span>, the first step is to identify lenders that offer products that suit your needs. Compare lenders&rsquo; terms and conditions online, as while personal loans can be used for many different purposes, some lenders will only agree to lend you money for the likes of buying a car or paying a medical bill, but not for debt consolidation, for example. Check the eligibility criteria of the various lenders to pinpoint those that will offer you the sort of loan you want.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use personal loans in Perth?</strong></h3>\n<p>Residents of Perth apply for personal loans to cover expenditure they have not budgeted for and make major purchases. Even if you have poor credit history or are self-employed, there are still lenders that will provide you with the right deal.</p>\n<p>Personal loans can be used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debt consolidation;</li>\n<li>Financial emergencies, such as unexpected medical bills;</li>\n<li>Making vital home repairs;</li>\n<li>Paying for a wedding;</li>\n<li>Purchasing a new vehicle, such as a car, caravan or motorcycle;</li>\n<li>Supporting a student at college.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features?</strong></h3>\n<p>Personal loans can potentially include several features, but not all of them are available with every lender. A loan with overpayment and redraw facilities or a line of credit is useful if you&rsquo;re looking for a degree of flexibility.</p>\n<p>Some personal loans come with associated financial products, such as a savings account, everyday account or credit card, for example. You can also take out a basic personal loan with a regular repayment schedule and nothing else, if it suits your needs.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need to look for a lender offering an unsecured loan if you don&rsquo;t want to secure your loan on an asset, such as your car or home.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of personal loans in Perth?</strong></h3>\n<p>A personal loan will help you to increase the capital available to you in an affordable, organised way. With the competitive nature of the personal loans marketplace in Perth, you can be assured of plenty of choice, meaning you should be able to pick out a lender who can provide the level of flexibility you require.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remember that some lenders charge for extra features such as making additional payments and redrawing, so it&rsquo;s best to check all charges and fees attached to any personal loan agreement before signing it.

You&rsquo;ll often spot this as a feature of variable rate loans. You can also be flexible about how you pay down your loan, for example using funds in a savings account to pay off some of the loan. If you have made extra repayments a redraw facility can allow you to claw back the extra amount in certain circumstances.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use a redraw facility?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are a number of reasons why you might want to use a redraw facility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You might like the idea of having an emergency fund at your disposal in case you incur unexpected expenditure, such as car repairs, urgent home refurbishment or medical bills;</li>\n<li>If you can afford to make extra payments at least a few times every year this would make it easier to manage your funds;</li>\n<li>Your extra payments will reduce the amount of debt you have and this in turn will reduce the interest you&rsquo;re paying.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features?</strong></h3>\n<p>Your redraw facility brings benefits because any extra payments made offset the capital or principal you have borrowed. The amount you pay in interest will therefore be reduced so you would benefit from repaying your loan more quickly; however, your lender may set limits on how much you can overpay and redraw. If you manage your redraw facility well you can use your home loan or mortgage like a transaction or everyday account.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may be able to pinpoint redraw facilities available for basic home loans and package home loans. Some interest only home loans also offer a redraw feature, as do some specialty home loans.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of redraw facilities?</strong></h3>\n<p>With redraw facilities you can make extra loan repayments when it suits you and then take extra funds when you need them. This is very useful in emergency situations or in other circumstances when you incur unforeseen expenses. A redraw facility also gives you peace of mind, as you know that you can continue to reduce the loan amount while you still have access to additional cash in your account.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind that some redraw facilities come with additional fees for withdrawing and depositing money. Lenders might charge these fees immediately or offer a specific number of free overpayments and redraws per month. In some cases redraw facilities may be limited to minimum amounts and lenders can also put limits on how frequently you use redraw facilities. This can make it difficult to redraw funds regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, if you choose to settle the loan in its entirety before the fixed term ends, with fixed rate home loans you may discover there are high exit fees, also known as break costs.</p>\n<p>Always check the terms and conditions of your loan contract for specific information about redraw restrictions.</p>",,5,15,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,8.0,386.0

When you have to find a bond or a deposit on the rental property it can be difficult to pay it all upfront, especially if you're not only paying a bond but a month's rent in advance.</p>\n<p><span>Rental bond loans</span> have been designed to help with these costs when you move into private rental accommodation and can make a significant difference to your initial outgoings.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use rental bond loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>When you're moving into any property, whether you are going to rent or own it, there are a lot of expenses to take care of. If you're getting a mortgage for a home you'll be aware of the need for a deposit and that there will be legal and other fees to take into account. When you are going to rent a property not only do you have to plan for how much the actual costs of moving your belongings will be but consider the fact that you will also have to pay a returnable bond and, likely as not, a month's rent in advance. This is where rental bond loans can help, and as the rental market can move very quickly it's easy to lose your dream property if you haven't got the funds quickly available. Loans may&nbsp;also help towards your removal costs, further lightening the initial financial load.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of rental bond loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Whoever lends you money for a rental bond loan will need to get a range of information from you to ensure you are eligible. Bear in mind that states and territories in Australia have schemes for these types of loan as well as private providers.</p>\n<p>The basic criteria for eligibility are that you are an Australian citizen, that you are over 18 and that you are in employment. Depending on the amount of a loan, lenders will agree a timescale for repayment. It can often be very short-term, if that suits your financial circumstances, but you should bear in mind that interest rates will be quite high so you should make plenty of comparisons before making a decision.

Unlike unsecured loans, where there is no asset placed as collateral protection for the lender, a secured loan gives that lender more comfort in the knowledge that if you default they may be able to sell the asset to get their money back.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use secured loans?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Secured loans are popular if you want to borrow a large sum of money, such as for purchasing a property or a new car, and in general you may be offered higher borrowing limits, lower interest rates (and, possibly, fees) and a longer term for the debt to be repaid. Understandably, lenders are unlikely to advance a large amount of money without some assurance that it will be repaid. If you put, for example, your house up as collateral the lender reckons you will do everything you can to keep up regular payments until the loan term is ended. Secured loans can also be advanced as home equity loans, based on the current market value of your home less the amount you still owe. Once again, the house is the collateral for the loan&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of secured loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>As the name indicates, a secured loan is secured on an asset that you possess. The most common form of a secured loan is when you take out a mortgage. The loan is secured on the property you are buying and the assurance of that kind of protection for the lender means they may offer more advantageous interest rates and let you borrow more than you would otherwise have been able to. Repayment periods for large <span>secured loans</span> can be up to 25 years, and some companies may offer an even longer period. When you are looking at the repayment period for a secured loan remember the longer the time you take to repay the more interest you will be paying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secured loans can be negotiated with either fixed or variable interest rates so you can make a measured decision as to which is most appropriate for your circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of secured loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Secured loans will generally offer larger amounts to borrow and, because they have collateral &ndash; which could also include personal belongings such as valuable jewellery or artworks &ndash; you may benefit from a lower interest rate than if your loan was unsecured. Longer repayment times can also be beneficial.</p>\n<p>If you fail to pay off the loan, for whatever reason, and you don't adhere to the loan's terms and conditions, the lender is entitled to the asset you have put up as collateral and could sell it to pay off your debt.&nbsp;</p>",,1300,270,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,265.0,168.0

Loans secured by car are one way of securing a loan and the lender takes a lien out on the vehicle. A bank or finance company will hold the ownership of the car until you have paid off the loan in full. This includes any applicable fees and interest, and when everything has been paid up the car reverts to your ownership. If you intend to use a loan to buy a new or second-hand car, where the loan is secured on it, you should check with financial institutions in terms of their requirements relating to the age of the car and whether you could split a loan to buy, for example, some furniture as well.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use loans secured by car?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Loans secured by car are useful when you want to borrow a significant amount of money. When a lender has an asset such as car as security you are likely to be able to borrow a larger amount than if your loan was unsecured, so if your car has a good value your borrowing options may be enhanced. That security, where in the event of you defaulting on loan repayments the lender has the right to sell the vehicle, can also offer benefits such as a lower interest rate on what you have borrowed and the possibility of having a longer time period to make repayments. It will depend on how much your loan is and it's worth comparing a range of potential lenders to look for the deal that suits you the best.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of loans secured by car?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>When you take out a <span>personal loan</span> secured by car you are giving an assurance to the lender in the form of a tangible asset. It is effectively a guarantee that they will get their money back one way or another. If you repay everything in full the ownership of the car reverts to you from being owned by the financial institution. Lenders believe&nbsp;you are more likely to pay off a secured loan because if you don't you effectively wasted a lot of money because they may then dispose of the vehicle to get their money returned. Look for good interest rates and negotiate your levels of repayment and how many years they will last.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Loans secured by car can be set up with either variable or fixed interest rates, enabling you to decide what best matches your personal circumstances.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of loans secured by car?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>With this type of loan you have the possibility of borrowing more by having the loan secured by car. You are more likely to get a lower interest rate and be able to have a longer time for repaying.</p>\n<p>Failing to pay off the loan will leave you seriously out of pocket and without your car, so bear that in mind when going ahead with this type of product.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

There are many ways a lender may have to offer you a secured loan, that is a lien over a property, car or other valuable item that ensures it gets its money back in the event of you defaulting on that loan. Another method is to offer <span>loans secured by deposit</span>, sometimes known as cash-secured loans, where your own savings are used as collateral for the loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In simple terms the loan is secured on savings accounts or certificates of deposits and you have to get a loan from the same bank where your cash savings are held. The bank then places a freeze on that account so you can't access it during the period of the loan until you pay it off. You'll still get interest paid on the amount frozen but you will also be paying interest on the loan secured by deposit. The interest you get, depending on how much it is, can help towards paying the loan interest, but you can't borrow more than the balance held in your savings account.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use loans secured by deposit?</strong></h3>\n<p>Although it may not be for everybody, and if you don't have savings you won't be eligible for this type of loan, they are often used for people who want to build up their credit again. Credit rebuilding can take time and if you've had problems with credit rating in the past it could be more difficult to get a conventional loan or an unsecured credit card. <span>Loans secured by deposit</span> means your bank is effectively lending you your own money. It has no real risk because it can take the cash from your account if you fail to repay the loan. Such loans are reported to credit agencies and can help boost your credit score. They are also useful because you don't have to wipe out your savings to get the money you need.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of loans secured by deposit?</strong></h3>\n<p>You can benefit from a lower interest rate because the bank has a lower risk as it's your money that is being used as collateral and they can get back the loan amount if you default on it. You will probably be asked what you want the loan for but that's up to your bank, and you don't have to borrow right up to the limit of your savings if you don't need to.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of loans secured by deposit?</strong></h3>\n<p>A lower interest is an attractive feature of this type of loan and it can be a helpful tool in rebuilding your credit score.</p>\n<p>If you don't pay back the loan, no matter what the reason, you could lose part or all of your savings depending on the agreement you have in place with your bank.</p>",,5,2,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.5,490.0

It doesn't matter if it's your first home, your second, third or fourth, or a property you are buying to rent out, you are nearly always likely to require a mortgage.</p>\n<p>In the vast majority of cases, mortgages are secured on the property, so even though you are the titular owner the home belongs to the lender until you have paid off the full amount your have borrowed. This is not just the principal but includes interest and any application or other fees that have been agreed. If you don't pay for any reason, your property is likely to be repossessed by the lender and sold to recoup some money.</p>\n<p>You may also be able to borrow against the equity in your home, the difference between its market value and how much the outstanding loan is, and that loan too would be secured by the property.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use loans secured by property?</strong></h3>\n<p>Buying a home is usually the largest purchase anyone will make and due to the sums involved a lender will want to be assured that it will get its money back one way or another. Nobody goes into a mortgage not expecting to pay it off but financial problems can happen and lenders don't like to be exposed.</p>\n<p>You may find that interest rates can be relatively low for loans secured by property, and you are also likely to get the option of many years, up to 25 or sometimes more, to pay off what you owe. Mortgages are tried and tested products in the financial markets and give people the opportunity to borrow large sums of money that might otherwise be unavailable to them.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of loans secured by property?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Good interest rates and long repayment schedules are attractive features of loans secured by property. You can sometimes get mortgage options to have a payment holiday, pay in more than the agreed amount or take advantage of products such as free offset accounts or loans that have no application fees.</p>\n<p>When you pay off your mortgage you will be in possession of a very valuable capital asset, one that may well have increased considerably in value over the years. You should always check the terms and conditions of a<span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans""> loan</a></span> secured by property to ensure you are getting a good deal that is suitable for your personal circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of loans secured by property?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>You are much more likely to get a large loan by using this type of product, a competitive interest rate and a good number of years to pay back the loan.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to pay back the loan, even if you have been repaying for a long time, your home is at risk of repossession. Every lender will warn you of the consequences and because the loan is secured on the property a lender could sell it to get a return on the money it lent and you would be left having paid out many thousands of dollars with nothing to show in return.</p>",,10,37,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,19.5,327.0

The shares or managed funds you invest in are used as the collateral to give the lender security. Shares loans are for those who are dedicated investors, so if you are looking to use a shares loan as an investment vehicle you should be someone that actively monitors and manages investments.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use shares loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>If developing your portfolio of investments is an integral part of your financial plans but you don't have sufficient spare cash to take out further investments, then shares loans can help to bridge that gap. You need to be knowledgeable about how the financial markets work and be clear about the pros and cons of this type of borrowing. It's not for everyone so if you are considering it make sure you really do have a broad understanding of what you are doing.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of shares loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>When you are loaned money to buy shares your lender uses the shares you buy as security. If you don't repay the loan the lender is entitled to sell the shares so the loan is repaid. Share prices move frequently, exposing you to the risk of them falling in value as well as increasing. Lenders will gauge the risk of a loan by using a Loan to Value Ratio (LVR). They will calculate the LVR by dividing the amount of your loan by the overall value of your shares. The majority of lenders will require you to maintain a LVR below 70%, with that being the maximum level. If your investment values fall to where the loan exceeds the agreed maximum LVR you may have to top up your investment or make a repayment of some of the loan, known as a ""margin call"".</p>\n<p>You should explore a range of options before taking out a <span>shares loan</span> to ensure you are getting an appropriate deal, especially relating to terms, conditions and fees.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of shares loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Shares loans are considered high risk. High risks mean that if the market in your shares does well you could make good money. Equally if the market falls you could be facing considerable losses and have to sell some of your investment to meet a margin call &ndash; the price will be low and you'll have lost money. If you use your home as collateral as well as shares you could lose it, and lenders may also require you to pay of the loan at short notice if they decide your collateral is no longer viable to secure your investment.</p>",,5,6,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,3.5,443.0

Students who don't have the benefit of parents to support them through their years of studying need sources of funding that are realistic in terms of how and when a loan needs to be repaid. <span>Student loans</span> are a common feature of &nbsp;higher education in many parts of&nbsp;the world. They give you access to money to support your living expenses and help to pay your tuition fees. These are personal loans, geared to you and your requirements throughout the period of your course. If you want to continue studying after gaining your first degree, you may be able to top up your student loan if your lender agrees.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use student loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are starting out at university you may not have&nbsp;sufficient savings to fund your studies. You may have had a part-time job but that's not likely to have given you a serious nest egg. So for many young people &ndash; and mature students as well &ndash; a student loan from either a public or private source of finance is part of the package. Taking out a student loan can rebalance your financial security over a number of years. You're aiming for a degree to improve your job opportunities with the potential over the progress of your career to earn more than you might otherwise have done.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of student loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Many banks, as well as the Australian government, offer loan programs to help you with your student finances. Lenders are well aware that most students won't have a steady income stream, wherever it comes from, and look to the potential you have for your future income. Loans from the government can be attractive in terms of good repayment conditions, but not everyone is necessarily eligible for these and even those in receipt of a government loan may need to top up from a private provider.</p>\n<p>Lenders may offer a<span> student loan</span> at below normal personal loan interest rates, an appealing option for many. You may also be able to defer repayments until you are in employment and begin to build up your finances.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of student loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>For many students a student loan is essential to be able to manage finances during the period of study. Often with low interest rates and favourable repayments terms, they can provide financial security while at university.</p>\n<p>If you take out a private loan and are able to defer payments that will help your immediate financial situation, but be aware that interest is likely to be charged on the loan right from the start, and after a number of years that can add a lot of money to what you will have to repay.</p>",,140,13,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,20.5,322.0

While this makes repayments less expensive, you need to be aware you will still owe the amount you originally borrowed at the end of the interest-only period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some financial institutions may make additional charges if you decide you want to make occasional overpayments so you can pay your personal loan off early, so be sure to find out before making a final decision.</p>\n<p>Other lenders offer redraw facilities, which means you can reclaim some of the overpayments you have made. While this is sometimes offered with no strings attached, some lenders restrict how much and how often you can reclaim overpayments, and some may charge a fee for this feature.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you&rsquo;re only permitted to take out a personal loan for some purposes, such as repairs to your home, and not others, such as debt consolidation, so it&rsquo;s best to check with the lender in question before applying.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of personal loans in Sydney?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>City life can be expensive, and personal loans offer extra funds for unforeseen expenses, such as medical bills or emergency repairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As with any financial arrangement, it&rsquo;s important to make sure your repayments are affordable and won&rsquo;t cause hardship for you or your family. Compare your options thoroughly before choosing a personal loan provider to ensure you get the best deal possible for your circumstances.</p>",,110,0,5,2,258,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,37.85,289.0

If so, the first thing to do is pause and ask yourself whether you really need the loan.</p>\n<p>Borrowing money can be expensive. It can also have serious long-term consequences if you&rsquo;re unable to repay the money. In that case, your credit rating will be damaged, which will make it harder for you to qualify for future loans. You might even be taken to court by the aggrieved lender.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve decided that you do, indeed, need a personal loan, your next step should be to conduct research. An obvious place to start is the comparison search tool at the top of this page. This tool will allow you to compare rates and features from a range of lenders, so you can get an idea of how much you&rsquo;d have to repay per month and how you&rsquo;d be able to manage the loan.</p>\n<p>As you do your research, one of the things you&rsquo;ll have to consider is whether your personal loan should be secured or unsecured. To make the process easier, we&rsquo;ve provided answers for a few commonly asked questions about unsecured loans.</p>\n<h3>What are unsecured loans?</h3>\n<p>Unsecured loans are personal loans where you don&rsquo;t have to provide the lender with any security, or collateral. That makes them different to secured loans, which are personal loans where you do need to provide security, such as property.</p>\n<p>If you default on a secured loan, the lender can seize your collateral, sell it and then use the sale proceeds to repay the loan. If you default on a secured loan, the lender will be unable to automatically seize one of your assets &ndash; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean your debt will magically disappear. The lender might pursue legal action and the court might then order the forced sale of one of your assets.</p>\n<h3>Why do people use unsecured loans?</h3>\n<p>There are two reasons why borrowers choose unsecured personal loans (which have higher interest rates) over secured personal loans (which have lower interest rates):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They&rsquo;re unable to provide adequate security &ndash; perhaps because they don&rsquo;t own any valuable assets or because those assets have been used to support other loans</li>\n<li>They&rsquo;re unwilling to provide adequate security &ndash; perhaps because they don&rsquo;t want to risk their assets or because they want to use those assets to support other loans</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before pursuing an unsecured personal loan, it could be worth doing an online credit check to make sure your credit score would qualify you for a loan. Lenders are usually willing to consider unsecured loans, but are likely to ask for evidence that you will be able to repay the money loaned to the term agreed between you.</p>\n<h3>What are the main features of unsecured loans?</h3>\n<p>The major difference between an unsecured and a secured loan is the interest rate you are likely to be charged, which is higher than if you have an asset with which to secure the loan. Unsecured loans can be useful if you want several thousand dollars for, say, a car, whitegoods or a holiday. As with any loan you need to be conscious of your ability to pay it back and so need to factor in whether you will go for a fixed or variable interest rate.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of unsecured loans?</h3>\n<p>The big advantage with unsecured loans is that you don&rsquo;t need to offer any collateral, such as a property or a car. The big disadvantage is that you&rsquo;ll be charged a higher interest rate than if you were able to offer collateral. Another disadvantage is that there are fewer lending options out there.</p>\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the difference between fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans?</h3>\n<p>A fixed-rate loan can&rsquo;t be changed during the period for which it&rsquo;s &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; or locked in. For example, if you take out a three-year fixed-rate personal loan priced at 9.75 per cent, you&rsquo;re guaranteed to be charged 9.75 per cent during that three-year period. However, if you take out a variable-rate loan priced at 9.75 per cent, the lender can change the interest rate whenever it likes &ndash; even the day after you get the loan. Variable loans can be moved up or down. People who fix tend to be pleased with their choice when interest rates move up but can regret not signing up for a variable loan when interest rates move down.</p>\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the difference between the advertised rate and the comparison rate?</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to be confused when you see a personal loan with two different interest rates &ndash; the advertised rate and the comparison rate. The main difference between the two is that comparison rate is usually higher than the advertised rate. (It can be the same, but it can never be lower.) The advertised rate is how much interest you&rsquo;ll be charged &ndash; but this figure can give a misleading impression of how much you&rsquo;ll have to pay, because it doesn&rsquo;t include fees. As a result, the comparison rate is regarded as the &lsquo;real&rsquo; interest rate, because it includes both the advertised interest rate and the fees.</p>\n<h3>How is the comparison rate calculated?</h3>\n<p>With personal loans, the comparison rate is based on a loan of $10,000 over three years. Comparison rates are also used for home loans and car loans &ndash; although based on a different formula.</p>\n<h3>What fees are charged for unsecured personal loans?</h3>\n<p>Fees differ from lender to lender, so you might be charged none, some or all of these fees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establishment fee</li>\n<li>Monthly account-keeping fee</li>\n<li>Late payment fee</li>\n<li>Repayment redraw fee</li>\n<li>Early repayment fee</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who offers unsecured personal loans?</h3>\n<p>Personal loans are offered by several dozen different lenders. That includes the big four banks &ndash; ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac. It also includes leading non-major banks like Citibank, HSBC, Bankwest, St George, Bank of Queensland, Suncorp, MyState, Bank of Melbourne, BankSA, Heritage Bank, Greater Bank, Hume Bank and IMB Bank. It also includes non-bank lenders like Pepper Money, Liberty and Latitude Financial Services. Personal loans are also offered by peer-to-peer lenders like SocietyOne, RateSetter, Harmoney and Moneyplace.</p>\n<h3>How much can I borrow with an unsecured personal loan?</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, asking how much you can borrow with an unsecured personal loan is like asking how long a piece of string is. That&rsquo;s because borrowing capacity differs from person to person and lender to lender.</p>\n<p>So just because a particular lender gives a friend of yours an unsecured personal loan of, say, $5,000, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the same lender will automatically give you a $5,000 unsecured personal loan. Also, if Lender X is willing to give you an unsecured personal loan of, say, $3,000, it doesn&rsquo;t mean Lender Y will also lend you $3,000 &ndash; Lender Y might only give you $2,000, or might not be willing to give you any money at all.</p>\n<h3>Is a credit card better than an unsecured personal loan?</h3>\n<p>As a general rule, borrowing money through a credit card is worse than taking out an unsecured personal loan, because the credit card will almost certainly charge higher interest. The one exception to the rule is if you borrow money through a credit card and then pay off the entire debt during the interest-free period &ndash; because, in that scenario, you won&rsquo;t be charged a cent of interest. However, you shouldn&rsquo;t attempt this strategy unless you&rsquo;re certain you can pull it off, otherwise it could land you in a debt trap.</p>",,2400,352,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,416.0,155.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Personal Loans that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<h1><strong><span>Variable&nbsp;rate personal loans</span></strong></h1>\n<p><span></span><span>If you&rsquo;re looking to take out a personal loan and are considering an option with a variable interest rate, then you&rsquo;ve come to the right place to compare the rates on offer from Australian lenders.</span></p>\n<p><span>A variable rate means that the amount of interest you pay on your personal loan will not be fixed in advance, but may instead be raised or lowered by your lender in accordance with the current economic conditions. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>By using RateCity to compare the different variable rate personal loans that are available, you can get a better idea of which lenders have offers that will best match up with your household&rsquo;s unique financial situation. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Advantages and disadvantages of a variable interest rate</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>When you compare the advertised interest rates for variable rate personal loans, keep in mind that what you see may not end up being what you get. If your lender cuts its interest rates, you may end up with lower monthly repayments than you initially budgeted for, leaving you with some surplus cash available. </span></p>\n<p><span>While you may want to put these savings to use somewhere else, many variable rate personal loans also offer the flexibility to pay extra onto your loan, allowing you to get ahead of your repayment schedule, bringing you closer to fully paying off your personal loan and making an early exit. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, it stands to reason that if interest rates on your personal loan can fall, they can also rise in the right economic conditions. Increasing interest rates can lead to more expensive monthly personal loan repayments, which can leave you short if you haven&rsquo;t budgeted accordingly. This can make variable rate personal loans a bit more high-maintenance to look after than their fixed rate counterparts. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Comparison rate</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>While it&rsquo;s worth comparing the advertised interest rates when choosing a lender for your personal loan, it&rsquo;s also worth remembering that the lowest advertised interest rate doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that you&rsquo;re getting the cheapest personal loan deal available. Even if your lender doesn&rsquo;t raise its rates, a low interest personal loan that charges high fees could be ultimately more expensive overall than a personal loan with higher interest rates and lower fees and charges.</span></p>\n<p><span>One alternative is to look at each personal loan&rsquo;s Comparison Rate, which combines its advertised interest rate with its standard fees and charges, to provide a more accurate guideline of the approximate costs of different personal loans. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s also worth keeping in mind that the each lender may charge nonstandard fees that aren&rsquo;t included in the personal loan&rsquo;s Comparison Rate. Alternatively, they may offer extra features and benefits that could make their personal loan more appealing to you. It&rsquo;s worth doing your homework after using the Comparison Rates to narrow down your shortlist of potential personal loans. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Debt consolidation</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you owe money to a variety of different lenders, then you may find yourself struggling to manage multiple repayments each month, as well as paying interest on each debt, each at a different rate. </span></p>\n<p><span>A simpler option could be to take out a personal loan to consolidate these debts. Not only would this mean making only one repayment per month, but you&rsquo;d also be making just the one interest payment per month, which could potentially work out cheaper than the previous arrangement.</span></p>\n<p><span>Not every variable rate personal loan can be used for debt consolidation, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to check first when making your comparisons, if that is your goal. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Secured/unsecured personal loans</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;d prefer to keep your personal loan&rsquo;s interest rates on the low side, then you may want to consider securing your loan. Secured personal loans guarantee the sum you borrow against the value of an asset that you own, whether that&rsquo;s a car, equity in your property, or something similar. Of course, to apply for one of these loans, you&rsquo;ll need one of these assets with enough value to reduce the lender&rsquo;s financial risk, so you can in turn enjoy a lower interest rate. </span></p>\n<p><span>Unsecured personal loans are also available, for when you don&rsquo;t have access to a high-value asset, or if you&rsquo;d prefer not to risk losing your asset to the lender if you&rsquo;re unable to make your repayments. However, due to their relatively high lender risk, these personal loans tend to have higher average interest rates than similar secured personal loans. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Early exit/extra repayment penalties</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>One reason why many people love variable interest rate loans is the flexibility they offer. If your lender chooses to cut interest rates, your monthly repayments could end up going down as a result, which gives you a choice &ndash; do you keep the savings from this discount, or do you take this opportunity to pay a little bit extra onto your loan, potentially paying it off early and ultimately paying a bit less in interest? </span></p>\n<p><span>If this prospect appeals to you, keep in mind that some lenders charge fees for making extra repayments on a personal loan or for making an early exit, to help make up for the interest payments they&rsquo;d be missing out on. These fees tend to be more common for Fixed Rate personal loans with pre-set repayment plans, though they are sometimes also applicable for Variable Rate Personal Loans. Don&rsquo;t end up surprised by extra charges if you try to pay off your personal loan early!</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Redraw Facility</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>When you have extra money available in your bank account, whether it&rsquo;s from a bonus, a tax refund, or left over in your budget following a rate cut, you may decide that making an extra repayment on your personal loan would be a great idea to bring you closer to getting your loan fully paid off. But what if there was an emergency and all of your cash was tied up in your personal loan?</span></p>\n<p><span>With this in mind, some lenders include a Redraw Facility as part of their personal loans. This nice little feature can be used when you get ahead on your personal loan repayments, and allows you to withdraw the surplus balance, subject to your lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions. By providing you with extra flexibility in how you use your finances, you&rsquo;ll have the option to make extra repayments onto your personal loan with confidence that you can still access this money again if you really need it. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>100% loans</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Do you have a deposit all saved up and ready to get your personal loan started? No? Well, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to miss out on your dream wedding or home renovation. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some lenders offer high LVR (Loan to Value Ratio) personal loans, where your deposit is smaller, and you borrow a greater percentage of your total instead. Some lenders can even provide personal loans where you borrow 100% of the balance, with no deposit required. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you do choose a high LVR or 100% personal loan, remember that you may find yourself paying a higher than average rate of interest, to make up for increased financial risk to your lender. It may be worth weighing up whether it would be more affordable for you to make higher monthly repayments, or to save up a full deposit before taking out a personal loan. </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Compare variable rate personal loans</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>By comparing the different personal loans that are currently available, you can work out which lenders offer the features and benefits that will perfectly match the requirements of your financial situation. </span></p>\n<p><span>At RateCity, you can compare a wide variety of personal loan providers, so start your search today and enjoy the benefits tomorrow! Or at least, when you get approval from the lender&hellip;</span></p>",,90,104,361,274,48379,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,4994.150000000001,44.0

Weddings can be extremely expensive, because no one really wants to cut corners. Of course, you will look at what is sensibly affordable and if you're lucky you&nbsp;may&nbsp;have supportive parents on both sides that will contribute towards the event. Even if you have, there may be quite a shortfall in what you have available, so you may want to look at <span>wedding loans</span> as a solution. This type of loan is for the specific purpose of helping to fund your wedding and there are many lenders who offer this type of personal loan so you can enjoy a really memorable occasion.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Why do people use wedding loans?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>A wedding, one hopes, is a one off occasion and an excuse to create a truly memorable event for family and friends. But it comes with considerable expense. However,&nbsp;if you decide you want to take out a wedding loan be sure you have the means to pay it back.</p>\n<p>When you think of what goes into making a wedding a success you quickly realise that the costs add up very quickly. You'll need to account for the cost of the venue and food and drink, wedding cars, clothes (especially the all-important bridal gown), paying the celebrant and any assistants, including an organist if you're having a church wedding, and a band or DJ for the after wedding party. And don't forget the flowers, photographer, hairdressing and other sundries that seem to appear from nowhere. It's not surprising that more and more people are taking out wedding loans to cover some of the expenses involved.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main features of wedding loans?</strong></h3>\n<p>Obtaining a wedding loan is a relatively straightforward transaction between you and a lender. It certainly helps if you and your intended are both in work and are looking for a joint loan, helping defray the costs of repayment. In common with most loans your income and ability to repay will be taken into account, you can choose from variable or <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans/fixed-rate"">fixed interest rates</a></span> and, depending on the amount of the loan, negotiate with the lender over the time period the loan has to be repaid. You should always make comparisons between what a variety of lenders offer and be clear about fees for applying and setting up the loan.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the pros and cons of wedding loans?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Having a wedding loan can realise your expectations so that you both have an amazing day to remember. As you start out in married life, with all the other costs you will experience, make sure your wedding loan is manageable financially so you don't get into a position where you have to default and incur penalties.&nbsp;</p>",,30,9,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,7.5,392.5

Or would you prioritise a savings account with the highest interest rate? </span></p>\n<p><span>In order to answer all of that, here are the options you can consider:</span></p>\n<h3>Online savings accounts</h3>\n<p><span>Getting an online savings account will allow you to access your savings account from anywhere, at any time, as long as you have your mobile phone and the banking app. Online savings accounts usually have higher interest rates, little to no fees, and best of all, it saves you the trouble of personally going to a bank and waiting on the long queues. </span></p>\n<h3>Bonus saver accounts</h3>\n<p><span>Some savings accounts will even give their customers bonus interest rates if they meet certain conditions specified. It could mean that you would have to meet a minimum monthly deposit or by imposing a withdrawal limit per month. This is ideal for those who want to keep their savings goals on track and for those who want to become better in saving up. Even better, you will be rewarded for your efforts in saving.</span></p>\n<h3>Introductory rate savings account</h3>\n<p><span>An introductory rate savings account offers an incentive many would be willing to sign up for, which is the introductory bonus rates. These bonus rates usually last for about four to six months upon signing up for the savings account. This appeals to people looking to switch savings accounts &ndash; and the introductory bonus rates offered rewards them for the switch. </span></p>\n<p><span>After the specified time period has expired, the savings account will return to the standard interest rate. This might be a good option for those with only a short-term savings goal or for those who simply want to have an account with a high interest rate (even if it&rsquo;s only short-term).</span></p>\n<h3>High-interest savings account</h3>\n<p><span>There are many competitive rates among various high-interest savings accounts in the market. The best part is that most of them don&rsquo;t have account-servicing fees. That means you&rsquo;ll get a higher return on the money you deposit into this account and you can meet your savings goals faster. </span></p>\n<h3>Minimum-deposit savings account</h3>\n<p><span>A minimum-deposit savings account forces you to make a monthly deposit in order to be awarded its high interest rates. The good news is that this gives you an incentive to consistently contribute, which will in turn boost your savings in the long run. Just make sure you do make these regular payments because penalties and fees usually apply if you fail to do so. Minimum deposit savings accounts generally don&rsquo;t allow you to make withdrawals, either. </span></p>\n<h3>Kids savings account</h3>\n<p><span>It might be good for you to introduce your children to a savings account, and there are savings accounts specifically for children under 18 years old. A kids savings account is generally like a standard savings account with monthly interest. The interest rates vary per bank but are usually competitive. Bonus interests are generally offered, as well. The best part? Fees and charges are usually waived. </span></p>\n<p><span>Take note, however, that monthly deposits are usually required and that there are also withdrawal restrictions you need to be made aware of.</span></p>\n<h3>Where to find and compare different savings accounts in Australia</h3>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another piece of good news: by using RateCity&rsquo;s online comparison tool (above), you can quickly and easily research and compare hundreds of different savings accounts throughout Australia.</p>\n<p>Having so much choice can seem overwhelming. But by comparing savings accounts online you can narrow your search to include only the options that best suit your needs, which makes selecting a savings account so much simpler.</p>\n<p>When you compare savings accounts in Australia using the RateCity comparison tool, all you have to do is enter your deposit amount, savings term and account type.</p>\n<p>To narrow your search, you can choose certain criteria to help you find a specific savings account in Australia. For instance, if you insist on having BPAY access, you can filter out all those lenders that don&rsquo;t offer BPAY access. Or if you&rsquo;d prefer to view results on savings accounts with ATM access or branch access, it&rsquo;s possible to drill down your search in this way too.</p>\n<h3>The difference between a base rate and a maximum rate</h3>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done your research, the next step is to decide how to view your search results. You can either group the results based on the base interest rate (either highest to lowest or lowest to highest) or the maximum interest rate (highest to lowest or vice versa).</p>\n<p>Some people are surprised to discover that there are two different types of interest rate, and are unsure what the differences are and why these differences exist.</p>\n<p>The base interest rate is the minimum interest rate you will be paid; the maximum interest rate is how much you can earn if you meet certain conditions.</p>\n<p>These conditions might include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minimum balance&nbsp;&ndash; </strong>you have to keep a certain amount of money in your account</li>\n<li><strong>Minimum deposit&nbsp;&ndash;</strong> you have to add a certain amount of money to your account each month</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum withdrawals&nbsp;&ndash;</strong> you can make only so&nbsp;many withdrawals per month</li>\n<li><strong>Linked products&nbsp;&ndash;</strong> you have to use another of the lender&rsquo;s products, such as a transaction account or credit card</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a general rule, you&rsquo;ll earn the maximum interest rate in those months where you meet all the conditions &ndash; otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be paid the base rate.</p>\n<p>Of course, conditions vary from lender to lender.</p>\n<p>Why, though, do lenders have two different types of interest rate? Lenders sometimes argue that it&rsquo;s to encourage good behaviour, such as saving more and spending less. Cynics sometimes argue that it gives lenders a chance to advertise higher interest rates but to pay lower interest rates.</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, don&rsquo;t sign up for a savings account unless you understand how much interest you&rsquo;ll be paid and what conditions apply.</p>",,390,141,516,462,52957,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,5551.900000000001,43.0

Most savings accounts offer a compound interest rate that is more competitive than the rate offered on your average transaction account. They can also be a convenient and safe way to invest your hard-earned savings: unlike other types of investments, you are very unlikely to get a negative return.</p>\n<p>There are many high-interest savings accounts to choose from in Australia &ndash; some offered by online lenders, others by small banks, or <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/companies/westpac"">Westpac</a>, <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/companies/commonwealth-bank"">Commonwealth Bank</a>, <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/companies/nab"">NAB</a> and <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/companies/anz"">ANZ</a>.

Securing a competitive interest rate can make a big difference to your savings over time. Our <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/calculator"">savings accounts calculator</a> can show you how.</p>\n<p>Most advertised savings account interest rates come with terms and conditions, so it&rsquo;s important to do your research. Some questions to ask when shopping for the best savings account interest rate are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is the interest rate offered an introductory rate? </strong>Sometimes called a &lsquo;honeymoon rate&rsquo;, an introductory rate is a high interest rate that only lasts for a certain period before reverting to a base rate. For example, a savings account may have an introductory fixed bonus rate for three months. After that time is over, the account switches over to the lower standard variable rate.</li>\n<li><strong>Is the interest rate offered a bonus rate? </strong>A bonus rate is a savings account interest rate that only applies if certain conditions are met, such as having an automatic savings plan with the lender, making a minimum monthly deposit, making a limited number of withdrawals in a month, or having a linked transaction account with the same lender. Bonus interest rates can help you save regularly and be disciplined with your spending. On the downside, some find them inflexible &ndash; especially if you can&rsquo;t deposit a regular amount into your savings account each month, or you want unlimited access to your funds without missing out on a high interest rate.</li>\n<li><strong>What is the base rate? </strong>This is the standard interest rate for a savings account &ndash; the rate your savings account will revert to once the honeymoon period is over, or if you don&rsquo;t meet the conditions for the bonus rate. When you compare high interest savings accounts, it&rsquo;s important to look at the base rate, not just the introductory or bonus rate, to find the best savings account interest rate on the market.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-55347"" alt=""istock_79305201_small5"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20170531130217/Bank-account-e1496199761772.jpg"" /></p>\n<h3>Saving account fees and accessibility</h3>\n<p>How easily you can access your money &ndash; and whether you pay a hefty fee to do so &ndash; is also worth considering alongside interest rates when searching for the best savings account in Australia.</p>\n<p>Although many lenders don&rsquo;t charge fees for maintaining a savings account, check if the product has any monthly account fees, branch deposit fees, ATM withdrawal fees or other transaction fees attached to it.</p>\n<p>Accessibility is another aspect to consider. If you plan to leave your money untouched to accrue interest, an account with a limited number of withdrawals and a higher interest rate may be your cup of tea. On the other hand, if you need to be able to access your money at any time, an account with ATM facilities and unlimited transfers may be more suitable.</p>\n<p>To help you compare accessibility, our online savings account comparison tool allows you to easily see whether a savings account has the following facilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ATM access</li>\n<li>Internet and phone facility</li>\n<li>Cheque facility</li>\n<li>Branch access</li>\n<li>Services such as BPAY and EFTPOS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s worth checking whether you can link the savings account to your existing bank account, or whether you will need to open another account with the lender. For example, if you open an <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/companies/anz"">ANZ</a> savings account, you may be required to have a transaction account with them as well. If you aren&rsquo;t an existing customer, this can lead to complications and additional bank fees.</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Pros and cons explained</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">Savings accounts for children</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/special-savings-accounts-children"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Term deposit account and savings account: what&rsquo;s the difference?</h3>\n<p>As you compare savings accounts, you may come across term deposit accounts and wonder how they differ from a savings account.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, a term deposit account locks away your money for a certain period &ndash; usually between one month and five years &ndash; at a fixed rate of interest. Unlike many high-interest savings accounts, a term deposit doesn&rsquo;t have an introductory or bonus rate, and usually requires a minimum deposit amount. If you choose to withdraw your money before the term is finished, the lender may charge you a penalty fee.</p>\n<p>As a low-maintenance investment that&rsquo;s relatively easy to set up, term deposits may suit savers who want to earn interest over time, or who want to shelter their funds from being spent. On the downside, a fixed interest rate means you won&rsquo;t benefit from any increases in the market interest rate.</p>\n<p><img style=""width: 100%;"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-55347"" alt=""istock_79305201_small5"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20170608111813/Save-money-2-e1496884747463.jpg"" /></p>\n<h3>How do I find a high interest savings account that&rsquo;s right for me?</h3>\n<p>Finding the best high-interest savings account will largely depend on who you are: your lifestyle, what type of saver you are, and the financial goals you want to achieve. There is no &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo;, which is why it&rsquo;s worth taking the time to compare high-interest savings accounts on the market.</p>\n<p>There are many products to suit your saving style, whatever that may be. If you are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A consistent saver &ndash; </strong>consider a savings account which offers a bonus interest rate. Regular and disciplined savers will be rewarded with a high interest rate by simply making a minimum deposit each month.</li>\n<li><strong>An impulsive saver &ndash; </strong>a savings account with a great introductory rate may be for you, though remember to check the maximum amount the rate applies to. Some people &lsquo;hop&rsquo; from lender to lender to take advantage of high interest introductory rates on the market. For example, you might put your money into a <a class=""rc-keyword"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/companies/commonwealth-bank"">Commonwealth Bank</a> savings account to get the higher introductory interest rate, then once the honeymoon period is over, search for another lender with a similarly competitive introductory rate and switch. Whatever your approach, make sure you check the terms and conditions before signing on.</li>\n<li><strong>The digitally savvy saver &ndash; </strong>if you prefer to do all your banking online, you might benefit from a high-interest savings account with an online lender, or bank that offers an online product. These types of savings accounts tend to have higher interest rates, as they require less overhead costs.</li>\n<li><strong>The couple saver</strong> &ndash; a joint savings account, which two or more people can access for deposits and withdrawals, might be a suitable option if you are living with a partner you trust and are both saving towards the same financial goals. Keep in mind there are two types of joint accounts: one which requires two parties to approve transactions, and one which allows either party to approve.</li>\n<li><strong>The junior saver &ndash; </strong>many banks offer high-interest savings accounts for children, often with bonus interest rates thrown into the deal. Opening a savings account can be a good way to teach children how to save regularly. To be eligible for an account, your child generally needs to be under the age of 16.</li>\n<li><strong>The senior saver</strong> &ndash; a pensioner high-interest savings account can help you grow your retirement funds if you&rsquo;re over the age of 55 and receiving the age pension. Many come with features that make it easier to manage your money, such as unlimited access, a debit card and bill pay.</li>\n<li><strong>The investor &ndash;</strong> a cash management account can be useful if you want to earn a high rate of interest while having the ability to trade shares or move funds between investments. While a cash management account may not offer the most competitive interest rate compared to other types of savings accounts, they generally have better accessibility to your funds and faster transfer times.</li>\n<li><strong>The business saver</strong> &ndash; high-interest business savings accounts offer a more competitive interest rate compared to business transaction accounts, allowing you to grow surplus cash while setting aside money for things like tax payments. Make sure you do your research to find the best bank for a savings account: many lenders require you to open a business transaction account with them, and minimum balance requirements may apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Banks v mattresses</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">How safe is the money I put in a bank?</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/safe-money-put-bank"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I apply for a high-interest savings account?</h3>\n<p>Most lenders have a form on their website that allows you to apply for a high-interest savings account.

That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re easy to open and easy to liquidate.</p>\n<p>Investing in, say, equities is less flexible, while investing in real estate is less flexible still.</p>\n<p>Of course, that flexibility comes at a cost, because savings accounts tend to deliver lower returns over the long term than equities and real estate.</p>\n<p>Still, you don&rsquo;t have to make an either-or choice. You can use a savings account as a source of emergency funds, filling it with enough money to cover, say, three to 12 months of expenses. You could then put any surplus funds into higher-yielding investments, such as equities and real estate.</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Keep an eye out for these 5 things</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">How to choose a savings account</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/look-choosing-savings-account"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Financial Claims Scheme</h3>\n<p>Another benefit of savings accounts is that they&rsquo;re covered by the federal government&rsquo;s Financial Claims Scheme.</p>\n<p>The <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.fcs.gov.au"">Financial Claims Scheme</a>, which was established in 2008, protects deposits in banks, building societies and credit unions if one of them collapses.</p>\n<p>Each account holder at each institution is protected for up to $250,000.

Most lenders won&rsquo;t charge you if you deposit money from your transaction account into your savings account, however lenders can charge you a branch deposit fee and/or an over-the-counter transaction fee if you try to do this in a branch. Talk to your lender about linking your transaction account to your online savings account to smooth this process and minimise fees. &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ol start=""2"">\n<li><strong><span>Make savings automatic</span></strong>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Some lenders also charge a monthly account-keeping fee if you don&rsquo;t deposit a certain amount into your savings account each month. Set up automatic deposits each month into your savings account from your transaction account, so you avoid pesky fees and have peace of mind.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=""3"">\n<li><strong><span>Track your savings progress</span></strong>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Savings accounts are also best used online as you can easily use them as a resource to track your savings progress.

Even some savings accounts offer special opening bonuses, allowing new users to get the most out of these accounts within the first few months of depositing their savings. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Compare savings account opening bonuses</span></h3>\n<p><span>Many savings account opening bonuses come in the form of high bonus interest rates on your savings. These higher rates allow you to maximise the interest you earn on the savings you deposit upon opening the account, so you can quickly grow your wealth. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that these high bonus interest rates won&rsquo;t last forever. The opening bonuses for many savings accounts are available for a limited time only, commonly between three and six months of opening the account. After this introductory period expires, the savings account&rsquo;s interest rate will revert to the base rate, which is typically much lower than the bonus rate. </span></p>\n<p><span>Selected banks and financial institutions offer other opening bonuses with their savings accounts, such as bonus reward points for your credit card, or even cash bonuses, though these tend to be promotional offers with extremely limited availability.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<h3><span>Other savings account bonuses</span></h3>\n<p><span>Some savings accounts have bonus rates that don&rsquo;t expire a pre-set number of months after opening the account, and could theoretically last indefinitely. For these accounts, receiving their high bonus interest rates typically depends on you fulfilling certain terms and conditions around how you use the account, such as:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Making a minimum number of deposits per month.</span></li>\n<li><span>Making a minimum number of deposits per month, or depositing savings of a minimum value in the account each month.</span></li>\n<li><span>Making no withdrawals, or less than the maximum number of withdrawals per month.</span></li>\n<li><span>Making regular use of a linked transaction account with the same bank or finance institution.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>As long as you can keep fulfilling your savings account&rsquo;s bonus conditions, you can keep earning the bonus rate of interest on your savings.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Avoid losing the bonus rate:</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">Don&rsquo;t let the banks steal your savings!</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/don-t-let-the-banks-steal-your-savings"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3><span>Other savings account features to compare:</span></h3>\n<p><span>The opening bonus is just one feature to compare when trying to choose a savings account. </span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Just the basics:</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">What to look for when choosing a savings account</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/look-choosing-savings-account"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>Depending on your household budget, and how you plan to use your savings account, there are other features and benefits worth comparing and considering:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>ATM and EFTPOS access can be helpful if you want to be able to access your savings while out and about.</span></li>\n<li><span>Branch access means you can have a face-to-face meeting with your local bank manager to discuss your savings plans, for that personal touch.</span></li>\n<li><span>Internet and BPAY facilities can allow you to manage your savings and finances quickly and simply at the touch of a button. </span></li>\n<li><span>Fees are worth considering when comparing savings accounts &ndash; high fees could end up costing you more than you earn in interest on your savings.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s important to remember that not every savings account will be ideally suited to every household&rsquo;s finances.

So the best regular savings account for one person won&rsquo;t necessarily be the best regular savings account for another.</p>\n<p>Another important point is that there are dozens of lenders offering hundreds of different savings accounts, so the market is in a constant state of change. In other words, just because you consider a particular product to be the best regular savings account on the market today, doesn&rsquo;t mean it will retain this title tomorrow.</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Learn from Richard Branson and others</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">5 habits of wealthy people</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/5-habits-wealthy-people"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>How to find the best regular savings account</h3>\n<p>As a result, it&rsquo;s important to shop around.

He opened the account 12 months ago and has built up his savings to $10,000.</p>\n<p>After doing some online research, Peter finds a savings account that pays a maximum interest rate of 3 per cent &ndash; provided he deposits at least $200 per month and makes no withdrawals. Peter is confident he can meet these conditions, so he moves his $10,000 to the new savings account.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how his balance would compare under the old account and new account:</p>\n<div class=""table-responsive"">\n<table class=""table table-striped"">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Year</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Old account</strong></th>\n<th><strong>New account</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Difference</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>$10,151</td>\n<td>$10,304</td>\n<td>$153</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>$10,304</td>\n<td>$10,617</td>\n<td>$313</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>$10,460</td>\n<td>$10,940</td>\n<td>$480</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>$10,618</td>\n<td>$11,273</td>\n<td>$655</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>$10,778</td>\n<td>$11,616</td>\n<td>$838</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>How the government protects savings accounts</h3>\n<p>During the Global Financial Crisis, people started worrying about the stability of local lenders following a series of high-profile international bank collapses.</p>\n<p>The federal government responded in 2008 by creating the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.fcs.gov.au/"">Financial Claims Scheme</a>, which protects the first $250,000 of each individual deposit at each bank, building society and credit union incorporated in Australia.

And the sooner they start building wealth, the easier they&rsquo;ll find it to take their first steps on the property ladder and save for their retirement.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of getting kids involved with saving is that they learn how to manage a bank account. The more they develop their financial literacy, the easier they&rsquo;ll find it to understand more complicated products and strategies later in life.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, a children&rsquo;s savings account can be a good way for children to learn about money, saving and banking.</p>\n<p>Most lenders that offer traditional savings accounts also offer dedicated savings accounts for children.

True to its name, a savings account is made separate from the usual transaction account so that you will not be tempted to spend the money there.</p>\n<p>In other words, your savings account is there for when you want to save up for anything, be it a gadget, your rent, a car or a trip abroad. It keeps the money separate from the account you use for everyday spending. It then becomes easier to track how much money you can set aside over a period time.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, a savings account is a good way to store money you intend to use for emergencies or purchases later on. Some call it their &ldquo;rainy day&rdquo; fund.</p>\n<h3>Types of savings accounts</h3>\n<p>Before choosing a type of savings account, have a savings plans first. Know what you want to save up for, whether it&rsquo;s a new mobile phone, a new pair of shoes, a car or even a property deposit.</p>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>-Online savings accounts</strong></span></p>\n<p>Getting an online savings account will allow you to access your savings account from anywhere, at any time, as long as you have your mobile phone and the banking app. &nbsp; Online savings accounts usually have higher interest rates, little to no fees and, best of all, save you the trouble of personally going to a bank and waiting on the long queues.</p>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>-Bonus saver accounts</strong></span></p>\n<p>Some savings accounts will even give their customers bonus interest rates if they meet certain conditions. It could involve meeting a minimum monthly deposit or sticking to a monthly withdrawal limit. This is ideal for those who want to keep their savings goals on track and for those who want to become better in saving up. Even better, you will be rewarded for your efforts in saving.</p>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>-Introductory-rate savings account</strong></span></p>\n<p>An introductory-rate savings account offers an incentive many would be willing to sign up for, which is the introductory bonus rates. These bonus rates usually last for about four to six months upon signing up for the savings account. This appeals to people looking to switch savings accounts&mdash;and the introductory bonus rates offered rewards them for the switch.</p>\n<p>After the specified time period has expired, the savings account will return to the standard interest rate. This is a good option for those with only a short-term savings goal or for those who simply want to have an account with a high interest rate (even if it&rsquo;s only short-term).</p>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>-High-interest savings account</strong></span></p>\n<p>There are many competitive rates among various high-interest savings accounts in the market. The best part is that most of them don&rsquo;t have account service fees. That means you&rsquo;ll get a higher return on the money you deposit into this account and therefore meet your savings goals faster.</p>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>-Minimum-deposit savings account</strong></span></p>\n<p>A minimum-deposit savings account forces you to make a monthly deposit in order to be awarded its high interest rates. The good news is that this gives you an incentive to consistently contribute, which will in turn boost your savings in the long run. Just make sure you do make these regular payments because penalties and fees often apply if you fail to do so. Minimum-deposit savings accounts generally don&rsquo;t allow you to make withdrawals either.</p>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>-Kids savings account</strong></span></p>\n<p>It might be good for you to introduce your children to a savings account, and there is a savings account specifically for children under 18 years old. A kids savings account is generally like a standard savings account with monthly interest. The interest rates also vary per bank and are competitive. Bonus interests are generally offered as well. The best part? Fees and charges are usually waived.</p>\n<p>Take note, however, that monthly deposits are usually required and that there are also withdrawal restrictions you need to be made aware of.</p>\n<h3>Why you should consider getting a savings account</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s always good to keep in mind that a savings account isn&rsquo;t a one-size-fits-all deal. You&rsquo;ll need to do a bit of your research and decide which kind of savings account best suits your savings plan.</p>\n<p>If you want to get a better hold of how you manage your finances, want to carry out a savings plan or simply want to have a fund for emergencies, you might want to consider getting a savings account.</p>\n<p>Although the specifics vary from one bank to another, a savings account generally has no monthly fee, a reasonable ongoing interest rate and withdrawal flexibility.</p>\n<p>Savings accounts are also generally linked to an everyday transaction account, which are both usually under the same bank. Some banks might allow you to link your savings account to a transaction account.</p>\n<p>While savings accounts generally have no fees, watch out for the fees in the everyday transaction accounts before you sign up for one.</p>\n<h3>What you need to know about savings accounts</h3>\n<p>A savings account also earns a certain amount of interest. The interest usually varies, but it&rsquo;s very low-risk. It also serves as a small reward in your efforts to save up.</p>\n<p>The way to access the money in the savings account is by logging onto your banking account and transferring the money from your savings account to your everyday transaction account. This also helps you manage your spending habits.</p>\n<p>Take note that there is a difference between a product&rsquo;s base interest rate and its maximum interest rate. As mentioned earlier, the base interest rate is the what you&rsquo;ll definitely get paid. A maximum interest rate, on the other hand, requires that you meet certain conditions first, such as restricted amount of withdrawals and minimum monthly deposits (such as $500).</p>\n<p>With some accounts, the gap between the base and maximum interest rates can be as high as two percentage points. Don&rsquo;t sign up for any account with a gap unless you know exactly what you&rsquo;d have to do to quality for the maximum interest rate.</p>\n<h3>Explore different savings scenarios</h3>\n<p>As part of your research, you might also want to crunch some numbers with&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/calculator"">RateCity&rsquo;s savings accounts calculator</a>. To use the calculator, all you need to do is input your deposit amount, deposit term and interest rate. The great thing about the calculator is that you can quickly and easily research different scenarios by changing the numbers.</p>\n<p>For example, if you invested $10,000 for five years, here&rsquo;s what balance you would finish with under different interest rate scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00% = $10,512</li>\n<li>50% = $10,778</li>\n<li>00% = $11,050</li>\n<li>50% = $11,330</li>\n<li>00% = $11,616</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you invested $10,000 at 3.00 per cent, here&rsquo;s what balance you would finish with under different loan term scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 year = $10,304</li>\n<li>2 years = $10,617</li>\n<li>3 years = $10,940</li>\n<li>4 years = $11,273</li>\n<li>5 years = $11,616</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you invested for five years at 3.00 per cent, here&rsquo;s what balance you would finish with under different deposit scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$2,000 = $2,323</li>\n<li>$4,000 = $4,646</li>\n<li>$6,000 = $6,969</li>\n<li>$8,000 = $9,293</li>\n<li>$10,000 = $11,616</li>\n</ul>",,1300,63,396,406,52884,0.6,0.125,0.125,0.75,0.75,40776.05,11.0

By offering a higher interest rate than everyday transaction accounts, high-interest savings accounts can help you reach your savings goals, sooner.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is a high-interest savings account?</strong></h3>\n<p>A high-interest savings account is similar to an everyday bank account. The main difference is that it&rsquo;s designed to help you save money by offering a higher interest rate than standard transaction accounts. Because high-interest rates are intended to help you save, not spend, they may incentivise you to make regular deposits. They also tend to limit the number of withdrawals you can make and may require you to maintain a minimum balance.</p>\n<p>Depending on the account, high-interest savings accounts work by adding compound interest to the money you deposit. Compound interest is interest paid by the lender on the initial amount deposited as well as the accumulated interest on the money in the high-interest savings account. Compound interest can help accelerate your savings because you earn interest on the money you initially deposit, as well as the interest you&rsquo;ve already earned. In essence, you&rsquo;re earning interest on interest. Compound interest on high-interest savings accounts is calculated daily and paid monthly.</p>\n<p>A high-interest savings account is generally linked to another bank account, within the same bank or to another bank. By linking an everyday account to a high-interest savings account, you should be able to transfer funds quickly between the two accounts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re comparing high-interest savings accounts, you might notice that some of the options listed are online savings accounts. These online savings accounts are high-interest savings accounts that you can apply for and manage via the internet. Unlike accounts from traditional banks, online accounts generally have fewer fees and higher interest rates because they have fewer overheads and bells and whistles. The other bonus is that because the account lives online, you can access your money 24/7 using internet banking.</p>\n<p>In most cases, an online high-interest savings account will need to be linked to another transaction account, which can be either an external bank or the same bank. Be sure to check whether these accounts have any additional fees or charges.</p>\n<p>Remember that any interest you earn from your high-interest savings account will need to be declared on your tax return. At the end of the financial year, you should get a statement or be able to access the amount through your internet banking.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the benefits of a high-interest savings accounts?</strong></h3>\n<p>High-interest savings accounts are designed to help you save. The main benefit of a high-interest savings account is that these types of accounts tend to pay a much higher interest rate than other everyday transaction accounts. If you&rsquo;ve got a goal in mind, this can help you get there faster. Depending on the high-interest savings account you opt for, some offer bonus interest rates if you meet specific criteria like not making any withdrawals. As an added incentive to open a high-interest savings account, some banks may offer an introductory bonus rate for an initial period.</p>\n<p>Unlike other investments, high-interest accounts are a safe option because you don&rsquo;t need to know anything about finance or investing. If you don&rsquo;t withdraw any money from your high-interest account and you continue to make regular deposits, you can&rsquo;t lose money on a high-interest savings account. Similar to term deposits, high-interest savings accounts are considered to be safe investments. In recent years, most banks and other regulated financial institutions are guaranteed by the Australian government. This means that if you deposit up to $250,000 into an account, the Australian government will guarantee that your entire balance is safe in the event that the lender collapses.</p>\n<p>Because your high-interest savings accounts will be earning compound interest, you should be able to see your balance grow relatively quickly. This can act as an incentive to help keep your goals on track. The other advantage of high-interest savings accounts is that opening and closing the accounts is usually very quick and straightforward. Because you&rsquo;re not locked into the account for any period, you can switch accounts at any time and potentially get a more significant return on your investment.</p>\n<p>Before you lock in a high-interest savings account, be sure to do your research and compare from several hundred accounts to choose the right rate and return for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>What to look for when comparing high-interest savings accounts</strong></h3>\n<p>Like any bank account, there are certain things you will want to look out for before you make a decision.</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re researching high-interest savings accounts, the first thing you want to compare is the interest rate. Most high-interest savings accounts will offer an introductory or promotional interest rate which is usually higher than the standard interest rate. While this can be a great way to earn more interest, it&rsquo;s often only for a limited period. Do your sums and check that when the promotional rate reverts to a standard interest rate, you&rsquo;re still coming out on top. At the end of the day, it all comes down to your needs. If you&rsquo;re looking to earn high interest over a short term, a promotional rate account might work for you. If you&rsquo;re looking for an account that grows your balance consistently over time, then look for an account with a strong base rate as well.</p>\n<p>High-interest savings accounts have variable interest rates which means they&rsquo;re vulnerable to changes in the market. If you&rsquo;re looking for a fixed return on your deposit, you may want to consider a <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/term-deposits/high-interest"">high-interest term deposit.</a></span></p>\n<p>Before you decide on an account, you might want to consider what features and facilities you need. If you opt for an online-only account, you may get a higher interest rate, but you won&rsquo;t have branch or ATM access. If you choose a traditional bank, your account may have more features, but in all likelihood it will also have a lower interest rate.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll also want to consider how often you&rsquo;ll need to access the funds. Some high-interest savings accounts have certain conditions around how often you can withdraw funds. In some cases, you may forfeit bonus interest if you make a withdrawal.</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re comparing high-interest savings accounts, you also want to consider whether the account has any fees and whether you need to link the high-interest savings account to a transaction account with the same bank.</p>\n<h3><strong>Alternatives to a high-interest savings account</strong></h3>\n<p>High-interest savings accounts are great to earn interest while building your savings. The savings account you choose ultimately depends on your lifestyle and personal situation. If you&rsquo;re looking for a fixed return and you don&rsquo;t need convenient access to the funds, you may want to consider a term deposit. <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/term-deposits"">Term deposits</a></span> range from 30 days to 10 years, and interest rates vary depending on the amount and length.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a mortgage, you may want to look into an offset account. In a nutshell, an offset account won&rsquo;t earn you any interest, but it will save you interest on your home loan. <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans"">Home loans</a></span> tend to have higher interest rates than high-interest savings accounts, so before you open either account, do your research and work out what you&rsquo;ll save versus what you stand to earn and see which works best for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to apply for a high-interest savings account</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve compared which high-interest savings account suits your needs, applications can generally be made online. If it&rsquo;s a more traditional bank, you may have to pop into a branch or apply over the phone. Whichever option you choose, you&rsquo;ll need to provide personal information like your address, date of birth and contact details, your tax file number and details of the high-interest account you&rsquo;d like to open.</p>",,9900,1187,5436,5078,542832,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,57443.8,8.0

A high yield savings account can help you grow your wealth by paying interest on your savings. A carefully-managed savings account, supported by regular deposits, can play a major role in helping you reach your financial goals much sooner than you may have anticipated.<br /> <span></span></p>\n<h3><span>What is a high yield savings account?</span></h3>\n<p><span>The yield on a savings account is the money you make from the interest earned on your savings. If your savings account earns more in interest than it costs in fees and charges, it has a positive yield, and makes money. If a savings account&rsquo;s fees and charges end up costing more than the interest it earns, it has a negative yield, and loses money.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Comparing the options?</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">What to look for when choosing a savings account</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/look-choosing-savings-account"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>Savings accounts with high interest rates may not always offer high yields, as they sometimes also have high fees. To maintain a high positive yield on a savings account, it&rsquo;s important to maintain a minimum savings balance that earns enough interest to counter the costs of any fees, and to continue making deposits so the interest you earn on your growing account balance can also increase over time. </span></p>\n<h3><span>How to find high yield savings accounts</span></h3>\n<p><span>For a savings account to offer a high yield, it needs a relatively high interest rate and relatively low fees. </span></p>\n<p><span>The base interest rate on a savings account is the minimum amount of interest you&rsquo;ll earn on the account. The maximum interest rate is the highest possible rate you can earn, though this higher rate may not always apply. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some savings accounts offer a high introductory interest rate when you first open the account, but this rate will eventually revert to the base interest rate when the introductory period ends, meaning you&rsquo;ll only earn interest at the maximum rate for a limited time only.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Other ways you can miss out on interest:</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">Don&rsquo;t let the banks steal your savings!</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/don-t-let-the-banks-steal-your-savings"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>Other savings accounts offer a high bonus interest rate, which you can potentially benefit from indefinitely, provided you continue to fulfil the account&rsquo;s bonus terms and conditions. These terms could include making a minimum number of deposits per month, depositing a minimum value into the account each month, or minimising the number of withdrawals you make each month. But as long as you&rsquo;re able to fulfil these conditions, you could potentially benefit from a much higher yield on your savings account. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Other features of high yield savings accounts</span></h3>\n<p><span>A high yield is important for a savings account, but depending on how you plan to use your account, other features could also be important when comparing the available options.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>If you value convenience, compare savings accounts that offer access via ATMs and EFTPOS. </span></li>\n<li><span>If you prefer to self-manage your money, compare savings accounts with internet and BPAY facilities.</span></li>\n<li><span>If you like being able to have a face to face conversation about your finances, compare savings accounts with branch access.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s always important to remember that every high yield savings account is different, and not every option will perfectly suit your unique finances.

Other accounts may let you benefit from higher bonus interest rates indefinitely, as long as you continue to fulfil certain criteria, such as making regular deposits, or minimising your withdrawals. </span></p>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s also important to consider whether you&rsquo;ll be charged fees for your joint savings account, and whether the interest you expect to earn on your savings will ultimately make these fees worthwhile.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">Settle down with your partner, and their finances</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">Financial considerations for newly married couples</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/transaction-accounts/articles/financial-considerations-for-newly-married-couples"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s always important to compare several joint savings account options before making your final decision, as the best account for one household may not be the best option for your unique budget.

One tool you can arm kids with to help them develop their personal finance skills is a savings account.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Kid&rsquo;s savings accounts are simple to use and understand. They help to teach children what savings are and the value of growing your money. Many lenders provide kids (consumers under 18) with savings accounts while also offering competitive interest rates.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Why open a children&rsquo;s saving account?</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p><span>Australian kids are running the risk of falling behind. Around a fifth of Aussie 15-year-olds do not have basic financial literacy, according to a recent OECD Programme for International Student Assessment report. Therefore, it&rsquo;s crucial to teach kids financial literacy as early as possible so that these skills trickle into all aspects of their life.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Here are several lessons you can teach your kids by opening a savings account:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Teach kids about income</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>By storing your kids&rsquo; pocket money or chore money into a savings account, they can better understand the concept of a salary or income. A piggy bank may feel like a low maintenance approach; however, it prevents them from learning that you can earn regular &ldquo;wages&rdquo; in return for labour or services that are transferred into a bank account.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>You can also print off their bank statement and talk it through with them, teaching them basic money concepts such as account balances, when and how the money comes into the account and interest.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ol start=""2"">\n<li><strong><span>Teach kids about budgeting</span></strong>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>A saving account is also a great way to show children how to budget. By storing their pocket money into a kids&rsquo; savings account they can then choose whether to spend the money now or save it for something bigger.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>ASIC recommends using a &ldquo;save 50 per cent, spend 40 per cent, donate 10 per cent&rdquo; rule as a good measurement to help kids understand the concept. Or, you can sit with them and help draw up a budget of how they&rsquo;d like to split their pocket money.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=""3"">\n<li><strong><span>Teach kids how to plan for a goal</span></strong>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Whether they want a new toy or a bike, every kid will have something they want to spend their money on. By setting a savings goal, you can help them to develop their patience and get a sense of forward planning. Sit with your child and talk through what their savings goal may be, and how the income they gain through pocket money and simple budgeting will help them to achieve this. If they&rsquo;re also old enough to understand interest, this is a great opportunity to see it in action. </span></p>\n<ol start=""4"">\n<li><strong><span>Teach kids about over-spending</span></strong>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Everyone makes mistakes and these are still great lessons to learn, especially at an early age. If your child spends all their pocket money in one go instead of putting it towards their savings goal they&rsquo;ll quickly understand they&rsquo;re even further away from that big-ticket item. They may feel disappointed, and you may feel tempted to help them out, but the experience will help them to budget better in the future. It&rsquo;s a lot easier of a habit to break early, before they&rsquo;re old enough to rack up huge amounts of debt on a credit card. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>",,590,0,0,0,50,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,64.0,248.0

Sometimes, the assumption is that if you&rsquo;ve seen one, you&rsquo;ve seen them all.</p>\n<p>The reality, though, is very different. Here are a few ways savings accounts can have different ratings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher interest rate v lower interest rate</li>\n<li>No monthly fees v monthly fees</li>\n<li>Maximum interest rate guaranteed v subject to conditions</li>\n<li>Branch access v no branch access</li>\n<li>ATM access v no ATM access</li>\n<li>EFTPOS facility v no EFTPOS facility</li>\n<li>Available to under-18s v not available</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another point to bear in mind is that there are dozens of different lenders offering hundreds of different savings accounts.</p>\n<p>With so many different products on the market, and with so many different criteria to consider, there can be a big difference in savings account ratings.</p>\n<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-55347"" alt=""istock_79305201_small5"" src=""http://production-content-assets.ratecity.com.au/20170908124358/Money-pile-1-e1504838666285.jpg"" /></p>\n<h3>What to look for when choosing a savings account</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re like most people, the first thing you&rsquo;ll look at when weighing up savings accounts is the different interest rates being offered.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s fine, but it&rsquo;s important to realise that the interest rate being advertised may not be the interest rate you receive.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How is that possible?&rdquo; you may ask.</p>\n<p>Well, some lenders offer a short-term bonus rate to new customers &ndash; for example, an extra 1.50 percentage points for the first three months. In this hypothetical scenario, you&rsquo;d earn the advertised interest rate for the first three months, but would then be paid the standard interest rate (which would be 1.50 percentage points lower). So you get baited with one interest rate and then switched to another.</p>\n<p>Some lenders use another version of this bait-and-switch tactic. Again, there are two interest rates &ndash; the (lower) base rate and the (higher) maximum rate. The maximum rate is the one that gets advertised, but you only earn this rate if you meet certain conditions during each calendar month. Otherwise, you get switched to the base rate.</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">five things to keep your eye on</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">What to look for when choosing a savings account</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/look-choosing-savings-account"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>What are those conditions? They differ from savings account to savings account, but one typical example is that you have to deposit a minimum amount each month &ndash; say, $1,000. Another example is that you have to minimise your withdrawals each month &ndash; this might be one or even zero. You might also be expected to use a linked product &ndash; a transaction account, say, or a credit card.</p>\n<p>Most people pay close attention to interest rates when choosing between savings accounts, but a surprising number of people don&rsquo;t show much interest in fees. That&rsquo;s a mistake, because fees can be surprisingly high, and can therefore eat up a surprising share of whatever interest you earn.</p>\n<p>Some products charge monthly account-keeping fees. Others impose withdrawal fees and minimum balance fees. You might also be charged fees if you bank cheques or request paper statements.</p>\n<p>Although interest rates and fees are the two main criteria when it comes to rating savings accounts, features are also important. These can include things like access to branches, ATMs, BPAY and EFTPOS.</p>\n<div>\n<div class=""link-bar"">\n<div class=""col-sm-7"">\n<h6 id=""btn-subtitle-test"">pros and cons explained</h6>\n<h3 id=""btn-title-test"">Should I get multiple bank accounts?</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=""col-sm-5 text-right""><a class=""btn btn-primary btn-lg"" id=""btn-test"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/pros-cons-multiple-bank-accounts"">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>How to research savings accounts</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering how to research savings accounts, a good place to start is by using RateCity&rsquo;s online comparison search (above).

Lenders want to help you achieve your savings goals, and higher than average interest rates will help you to grow your nest egg faster than making regular deposits.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=""2"">\n<li><strong><span>Bonus interest rates</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>If a competitive interest rate is not enough to make you join with a lender, they may also offer a bonus interest rate. These are a valuable tool to help you in your savings journey. This is interest that is earned on top of your existing interest rate, usually for following a set of conditions. These may include meeting a minimum monthly deposit, or a set minimum amount of withdrawals. Not only does this discourage you from dipping into your savings, you&rsquo;re also rewarded for this good behaviour.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=""3"">\n<li><strong><span>Promotional interest rate</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>This is different to bonus interest rates as promotional interest rates are offered as a one off, higher rate to new customers. Promotional interest rates are for a limited time only, but unlike bonus rates they do not come with restrictions. Before joining up, ensure you&rsquo;ve checked what the standard interest rate is that the savings account will revert to once this promotional period is over.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=""4"">\n<li><strong><span>Age restrictions</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Savings accounts will have a minimum age restriction. If you&rsquo;re looking to open a savings account for your child, you&rsquo;ll want to compare children&rsquo;s savings accounts. Children&rsquo;s savings accounts are a fantastic educational tool to help teach kids financial literacy and other money concepts, such as income, budgeting and how to achieve a savings goal. <strong><br /> </strong></span></p>\n<ol start=""5"">\n<li><strong><span>Minimum monthly deposits</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Some lenders will have a set amount you are required to deposit each month, to help encourage you to reach your savings goals. Minimum monthly deposits can often accrue bonus interest if followed. If this is something you&rsquo;re not confident you can match, it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind when comparing savings accounts.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ol start=""6"">\n<li><strong><span>Minimum opening deposit</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Some lenders may ask you to make a minimum deposit before they open your savings account, usually to cover any account opening costs. This feature may be a deterrent, especially if you haven&rsquo;t yet started your savings journey.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=""7"">\n<li><strong><span>Free account statements</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Your account statement isn&rsquo;t always free. Some lenders charge you a fee to send this to you, particularly via post. If you&rsquo;re not ready to make the move to email, it&rsquo;s worth considering whether your savings account will charge you over a monthly or quarterly statement.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ol start=""8"">\n<li><strong><span>Account keeping fees</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>These include anything from annual fees, ATM withdrawal fees and monthly fees. There are plenty of savings accounts that do not charge their customers any of these fees, so you should consider whether this is something you could afford to chip away at your savings. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>",,90,0,0,0,14,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,10.4,372.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Superannuation that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p><span>When comparing superannuation funds, small details make a big difference. Superannuation administration fees is one of these details. A fund with lower administration fees has the potential to increase your balance over time, but this isn&rsquo;t always going to be the right fit for your situation. We&rsquo;re going to look at super administration fees, how they work, how much you can expect to pay, and the circumstances where it might be an idea to shop around for a better deal. </span></p>\n<h3>What are superannuation administration fees?</h3>\n<p><span>Superannuation providers generally charge administration (or management) fees, to cover the upkeep of your super account, and the overall fund. For example, you should expect a portion of your fees to be used for the distribution of your super statements.</span></p>\n<h3>How are superannuation administration fees calculated?</h3>\n<p><span>The way your super administration fee is calculated will depend on your account. Some will use a tiered fee structure, while others will charge at a flat yearly rate. Super admin fees are generally calculated weekly and deducted from your account at the end of the month. </span></p>\n<h3>Are there funds that don&rsquo;t charge superannuation fees?</h3>\n<p><span>With competition fierce in the superannuation industry, many providers are offering super accounts with $0 administration fees. This can be a great way to maximise your retirement savings and the amount of super you can access, but it is important to acknowledge the other features of the account and whether they&rsquo;re in line with expectations. </span></p>\n<h3>How can you find funds that don&rsquo;t charge superannuation administration fees?</h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re not comfortable with the superannuation administration fees you&rsquo;re being slugged with, it&rsquo;s important to test the market. RateCity can help you compare super funds by the amount of admin fees you can expect to pay, to help you find the best fit as a consumer. </span></p>\n<h3>What other fees can I expect from my super fund?</h3>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, administration fees are just the start of the charges you can expect from your super fund, which is why it&rsquo;s so important to test the market. While the fee types and amounts vary from provider to provider, you can generally expect to be charged:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investment fees &ndash; These cover the costs of managing your investment</li>\n<li>Indirect costs &ndash; Any charges your fund will pay to external providers</li>\n<li>Advice fees &ndash; Payments for investment advice from your fund</li>\n<li>Switching fees &ndash; Payments associated with altering investment options</li>\n<li>Buy/sell spread &ndash; Fees covering any fund transactions</li>\n<li>Insurance premiums &ndash; Charges associated with insurance provided by your fund</li>\n<li>Exit fees &ndash; Payable should you choose to leave the fund</li>\n<li>Activity-based fees &ndash; Incurred whenever your fund provides an additional service</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span> How do you change superannuation funds?</span></h3>\n<p><span>Many consumers feel changing funds can be a daunting prospect, but websites like RateCity provide a quick and easy way to compare funds by administration fees, returns and benefits and see which policy works best for you and your financial goals.</span></p>",,20,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2.0,473.5

Because the 457 visa is temporary, you might be wondering what happens to the compulsory super contributions when you leave the country. When you depart Australia for good, any superannuation earnt while you were working on a 457 visa can be claimed through the Australian Taxation Office or directly through the superannuation fund.</p>\n<h3>What is 457 visa superannuation?</h3>\n<p>In Australia, it&rsquo;s not just permanent residents that contribute to superannuation savings. Regardless of whether you&rsquo;re a permanent or temporary Australian resident on a 457 visa, if you&rsquo;re employed in Australia, your employer will have to make compulsory superannuation contributions on your behalf. In Australia, the current superannuation rate is 9.5 per cent of the employee&rsquo;s salary. If you&rsquo;re an employee with a valid Australian working visa, your employer is legally obligated to contribute 9.5 per cent of your salary to your nominated superfund each quarter.</p>\n<p>Temporary residents on 457 working visas will inevitably build up superannuation benefits, which can be claimed once they&rsquo;ve permanently departed the country.</p>\n<h3>What to look for in a 457 superannuation fund?</h3>\n<p>When you start a new job, your employer will give you an option to pay your 457 visa superannuation contributions into a fund chosen by you, or a default fund of their choosing. If you&rsquo;re a temporary resident on a 457 visa, knowing how to <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/superannuation"">pick a superannuation fund </a></span>can be confusing. Here&rsquo;s what to consider when comparing 457 visa superannuation funds.</p>\n<p>Start by getting as much information about the 457 visa superannuation fund as possible; comparing funds and options will be much easier if you have more information. While a fund&rsquo;s past performance is never a guarantee, it does help paint a short- and long-term picture of what kind of investment you&rsquo;ll be making. The other factor you&rsquo;ll want to consider when<span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/superannuation""> choosing superannuation</a></span> for your 457 visa is accessibility. You&rsquo;ll want to know how easily you can access your funds and keep track of the contributions your employer is making while you work. Other features to look out for are insurance fees and overall value for money.</p>\n<p>Much like any other investment or financial product, superfunds charge various types of admin fees. Depending on how much you earn, these fees can eat into your contributions and cost you.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens to my 457 visa super when I leave Australia?</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on your super fund and how long ago you permanently left Australia, you can claim your superannuation benefits through the Australian Taxation Office or directly through your 457 visa superannuation fund. If it&rsquo;s been less than six months since your 457 visa expired or you permanently left Australia, you may be able to claim your funds directly through your superannuation fund. If it&rsquo;s been longer than six months, you may need to contact the Australian Taxation Office and apply for a departing-Australia superannuation payment. Before you claim your 457 visa superannuation, check whether there are any tax implications or legalities involved in withdrawing your superannuation.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that, as of March 2018, the 457 visa will be replaced by a new temporary skill shortage visa (TSS). While the visa requirements may change, at this stage, there are no changes planned to the eligibility requirements for superannuation.</p>",,5,0,5,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.25,499.0

If you&rsquo;ve arranged your superannuation, Adelaide, the surrounding suburbs, or regional South Australia are all valid destinations for settling down.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Whether you&rsquo;re working in Adelaide or elsewhere in South Australia, there are local and national superannuation fund options available for you to choose from.</span></p>\n<h3><span>What is superannuation?</span></h3>\n<p><span>It&rsquo;s important for all Australians, and not just those from Adelaide, to understand the basics of superannuation &ndash; this knowledge will be important when the time comes to retire, whether that date is near or far.</span></p>\n<p><span>Superannuation is a type of retirement fund. If an employer pays you wages or a salary over a certain threshold, Australian law requires that a minimum percentage of your earnings be deposited into this investment fund, where they can earn interest until you&rsquo;re ready to stop working.</span></p>\n<p><span>Saving money in a super fund can help you avoid working hard all your life, only to retire and discover you have nothing to live on in your old age. While there is the government old-age pension, securing your retirement savings through superannuation can make a big difference if you&rsquo;re hoping to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle in retirement.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Consolidating super</span></h3>\n<p><span>Unless you&rsquo;ve worked for the same Adelaide business your entire life, you may already have more than one superannuation account open in your name. Many Australians open a new superannuation account each time they start a new job, and end up with their retirement savings split between multiple funds as a result. Having multiple super accounts can mean losing more money per year in annual account-keeping fees than what you earn in super payments and interest.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some South Australians even lose their super &ndash; leaving it abandoned in super funds from old jobs and never rolling it over to new accounts. After a certain length of time, if the fund provider is unable to get in touch with you, your super will be declared &ldquo;lost&rdquo; and put under the control of the Australian Tax Office until you come to claim it.</span></p>\n<h3><span>How do I create a super account?</span></h3>\n<p><span>There&rsquo;s a lot for<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Adelaidians<span>&nbsp;</span><span>to consider when choosing a super fund. Most Australians are free to choose whatever type of fund they think will best suit their finances, though some workers are covered by industrial agreements or are members of defined benefits funds.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are more than 200 different superannuation funds in Australia, so it&rsquo;s important to research your superannuation options, considering fees and charges, interest rates, investment options, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;ve decided on your preferred superannuation fund, head to that provider&rsquo;s website, where you should be able to fill in an online application or download the appropriate forms. You&rsquo;ll need your tax file number (assuming you don&rsquo;t want to be charged a higher tax rate), your contact details, and your employer&rsquo;s details (if you&rsquo;re employed).</span></p>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re satisfied with your choice of superannuation fund, you can relax and look forward to your retirement, whether that&rsquo;s in Adelaide or the surrounding countryside.</span></p>",,5,0,3,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.95,541.0

You should think of it like any other asset, which means getting actively involved in its performance &ndash; not just letting it sit in the background and hoping it&rsquo;s all okay when you&rsquo;re ready to retire.</p>\n<p>Getting informed specialist advice about how to invest and manage your super has become an increasingly important component for people trying to plan their future with a minimum of stress. A superannuation or general financial advisory firm can offer suggestions about how to invest and manage your superannuation fund.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to look for an independent advisory service that is not being rewarded with commissions for selling you specific financial products. An adviser on superannuation advice or retirement planning should charge you a fee, not accept commissions.</p>\n<h3>What sort of advice can I get?</h3>\n<p>A superannuation advisory service can offer a range of advice, depending on your individual needs. Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explaining the different superannuation choices and contribution limits</li>\n<li>Providing advice about the performance of different types of super funds or recommending one structure over another</li>\n<li>Providing advice about the potential value of consolidating your super assets into a single fund</li>\n<li>Assisting you to roll-over assets into a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF)</li>\n<li>Providing information on any insurance risks associated with changing your superannuation fund</li>\n<li>Providing advice about the tax advice implications for superannuation</li>\n<li>Helping you establish your own (SMSF), including:</li>\n<li>advice on the type of investments the fund should acquire</li>\n<li>how to manage the fund</li>\n<li>the pros and cons of a corporate trustee versus an individual trustee for the fund</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A superannuation advisory service can help you identify your retirement financial goals and develop a plan to enable you to achieve them over time. If, like a lot of people, you tend to put financial matters in the too-hard basket, having a plan and someone helping motivate you to achieve it can make a real difference in the long term.</p>\n<h3>How do I find the right superannuation adviser?</h3>\n<p>To start with, ask yourself, &lsquo;What is my approach to financial planning?&rsquo; Are you a risk-taker or do you prefer to play the long game with a slow-and-steady approach? Make sure the superannuation advisor&rsquo;s investing philosophy isn&rsquo;t too aggressive or too cautious for your needs. Find out how they will carry out their recommendations.</p>\n<p>Some advisors cater to clients with a particular range of assets, so it&rsquo;s important to make sure the advisor is a good fit for your individual financial situation.</p>\n<p>Also, check you are both comfortable with the amount of input you want to have. Do you want to leave it effectively in their hands while you get on with other things, or do you want regular contact?</p>\n<p>Remember, too, that the type of advice you need may also change over time, depending on what stage of your life you&rsquo;re at. For example, whether you&rsquo;re going through big changes in work or personal life, such as getting married or starting a family.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

And they can be tricky to understand. However, they&rsquo;re particularly important if you&rsquo;re an older Australians or trustee of your own self-managed super fund.</p>\n<h3>What is a superannuation anti-detriment payment?</h3>\n<p>An&nbsp;anti-detriment payment, also referred to as a &lsquo;tax saving amount&rsquo;, is a refund of the tax contributions paid on a superannuation account, in the event of the member&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;It is paid to the spouse or children of the deceased as part of a death benefit.</p>\n<h3>Who is eligible to receive an anti-detriment payment?</h3>\n<p>Anti-detriment payments are payable to the deceased&rsquo;s dependants nominated through a binding nomination form. This usually includes the spouse, former spouse or children of the deceased. In the event that no binding nomination form has been completed, the superannuation trustee usually determines the beneficiary. However, it rarely extends beyond immediate family.</p>\n<h3>How much is paid to the beneficiary?</h3>\n<p>The amount paid to the beneficiary varies based on how much tax has been paid on the deceased&rsquo;s taxable superannuation contributions.</p>\n<p>It can be tricky to wrap your head around, so here&rsquo;s an example:</p>\n<p>Sarah makes a taxable contribution to her superannuation fund of $100,000. Her super fund pays 10 percent tax, leaving Sarah&rsquo;s new balance at $90,000 &ndash; a &lsquo;detriment&rsquo; of $10,000.</p>\n<p>In the event that Sarah passes away, the trustee of her superannuation fund combines the $90,000 death benefit with the detriment amount of $10,000, to pay a total &lsquo;anti-detriment&rsquo; amount of $100,000 to Sarah&rsquo;s beneficiary.</p>\n<h3>What changes have occurred to anti-detriment payments?</h3>\n<p>Previously, the trustee of the deceased&rsquo;s super fund was compensated for the extra detriment amount they had to pay to the deceased&rsquo;s beneficiary. For instance, in the example above, the trustee would be eligible to a $100,000 deduction.</p>\n<p>However, from 1&nbsp;July 2017, super funds are no longer eligible for this deduction. This government initiative seeks to standardise the treatment of lump sum death benefits across all super funds.</p>\n<h3>How does it work for self-managed super funds?</h3>\n<p>For self-managed superannuation funds, managing anti-detriment payments can be challenging for a couple of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They need to have large amounts of funds at the ready, to pay out in the event of a member&rsquo;s death</li>\n<li>They need to utilise the deduction, which can often be hundreds of thousands of dollars</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it might be a good idea to set aside reserve funds, take out insurance to cover the payable benefit or focus on attracting new, younger members to your self-managed fund to decrease the likelihood of a large pay-outs occurring.</p>\n<h3>Where do I seek further advice on anti-detriment payments?</h3>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a nominated beneficiary, are looking to nominate a dependent for your own fund or are a trustee of a self-managed super fund, it might be a good idea to seek assistance or advice from a tax agent or financial professional.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

It invests in a variety of assets to grow its members&rsquo; savings. The company&rsquo;s approach is based on its four core investment beliefs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All profits should be returned to members</li>\n<li>Active management in asset allocation and selection of stocks</li>\n<li>Using scale to reduce costs and achieve a better structure of investments</li>\n<li>A responsibility to the broader community, while maintaining obligations to members</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Members also have access to the following insurances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death cover</li>\n<li>Total permanent disability (TPD)</li>\n<li>Income protection</li>\n<li>Terminal illness benefit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Members are able get advice about superannuation, investment choices, insurance and retirement planning via telephone, or by meeting in person with a financial adviser.</p>\n<p>AustralianSuper is run only for its members. It does not pay profits or dividends to shareholders, meaning that all money made goes back into the members&rsquo; fund.</p>\n<h3>How does AustralianSuper invest?</h3>\n<p>Because some asset classes can be volatile, AustralianSuper attempts to minimise such risk through diversification across and within asset classes. For example, it invests in property and infrastructure, which perform differently to more conventional growth assets and can offer reasonable returns even during times of volatility in the share market. Similarly, it attempts to stay flexible and responsive to market conditions adjusting investments as necessary.</p>\n<p>The primary areas of investment are:</p>\n<p><strong>Cash</strong></p>\n<p>Money market securities (e.g. bank bills and short-term bonds that are held with banks, the government or companies)</p>\n<p><strong>Credit</strong></p>\n<p>Debt securities and loans issued by companies and other entities.</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed interest (bonds)</strong></p>\n<p>Loans to governments, private companies and banks that are issued as securities and pay regular interest over a set term.</p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>\n<p>Essential public facilities and services such as roads, airports, seaports in Australia and overseas. Another example is Ausgrid, which delivers electricity to around 1.7 million homes and businesses in NSW.</p>\n<p>In December 2016, AustralianSuper made one of the biggest infrastructure investments ever in Australia when, with IFM Investors, it acquired a 50.4 per cent stake in Ausgrid from the NSW government.</p>\n<p><strong>Private equity</strong></p>\n<p>Investment in Australian and international companies that are not listed on a stock exchange.</p>\n<p><strong>Other assets</strong></p>\n<p>Includes assets such as commodities, royalties or leases.</p>\n<p><strong>Shares (stocks, securities, equities)</strong></p>\n<p>Large and small companies across a range of industries in Australia and overseas.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct property</strong></p>\n<p>Direct holdings in residential, retail, industrial or commercial real estate.</p>\n<p><strong>Listed property</strong></p>\n<p>An investment company that owns assets related to real estate such as buildings, land and real estate securities.</p>\n<p>Within each of these classes of investment are dozens of individual investments.</p>\n<p>The company also has a &lsquo;socially aware&rsquo; investment option for members who want to put their money into assets that consider environmental, social and governance standards in their operation. For example, it will not invest in companies that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directly own reserves of coal, oil, gas or uranium</li>\n<li>Produce tobacco, cluster munitions or landmines</li>\n<li>Have single-gender (i.e. exclusively male or female) boards (ASX 200 companies only)</li>\n<li>Have been identified as having human rights, labour, environmental or governance controversies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, it may still invest in companies that invest in, provide services to, or buy, process or sell products from the excluded companies. For example, companies that have shareholdings in, or banks that lend money to, an excluded company, plus service providers like security, catering or office suppliers or petrol refiners and distributors.</p>\n<p>Also, members have the option to take a hands-on approach and create their own investment portfolio and level of investment in each asset class from the company&rsquo;s options, or allow AustralianSuper to completely manage their investments.</p>\n<h3>What fees are involved?</h3>\n<p>AustralianSuper charges an &lsquo;investment fee&rsquo; to cover the cost of managing your money. This fee is made of up three components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investment management fees &ndash;</strong> amounts that relate to management functions, such as administrative costs</li>\n<li><strong>Performance-related fees &ndash; </strong>fees paid to external investment managers for generating positive returns</li>\n<li><strong>Transactional and operational costs &ndash;</strong> a broad category of costs relating to the buying or selling of investments (e.g. brokerage and commission)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The overall Investment fee is deducted from before-tax investment returns on your investments, before the returns are applied to your account.</p>\n<p>Fees for the AustralianSuper Balanced option are below the industry average across all assessed account balances.</p>\n<h3>How do I sign up with AustralianSuper?</h3>\n<p>You can sign up for an account online at the AustralianSuper website or by printing an application form from their website and returning it by post. You can also contact AustralianSuper:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1300 300 273 (available 8:00am to 8:00pm weekdays AEST/AEDT)</li>\n<li>Overseas callers + 61 3 9067 2018</li>\n<li>Email: available on their website</li>\n<li>Post\n<ul>\n<li>Super: GPO Box 1901 Melbourne VIC 3001</li>\n<li>Retirement income: Locked Bag 6 Carlton South VIC 3053</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",,201000,4,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,20102.0,24.0

Top-performing super funds usually boast the most robust returns on investment during a financial year, but overall suitability for you should be judged on a number of factors.</p>\n<p>While strong returns are positive, it&rsquo;s important to consider whether a fund&rsquo;s investment options and features are appropriate for your particular circumstances.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to judge a super fund&rsquo;s performance</strong></h3>\n<p>The reality is that no one can predict which will continue to be the best performing fund with perfect accuracy. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s advisable to choose the right investment strategy for your financial goals, and expect to encounter some ups and downs in your investment over the long term.</p>\n<p>However, there are a number of indicators that you can use to judge a super fund&rsquo;s overall performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Long-term returns &ndash;</strong> Returns on investment change regularly, so last year&rsquo;s top performer may not meet expectations this year. Instead, it&rsquo;s often best to judge a fund by its performance over at least five years.</li>\n<li><strong>Fees and tax &ndash;</strong> Look at the fund&rsquo;s returns after fees and tax have been deducted.</li>\n<li><strong>Like-for-like comparison</strong> &ndash; Compare funds with other funds that have similar investment approaches. For example, if a fund invests 85 per cent of its money in property and shares, compare with other similar investment mixes rather than, say, a cash investment fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>How to compare super funds in Australia</strong></h3>\n<p>There are some key factors to consider when comparing super funds and weighing up your options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance &ndash;</strong> As above, it&rsquo;s often best to look at returns over a period of at least five years, minus fees and tax.</li>\n<li><strong>Fees &ndash;</strong> The lower the better, as they can add up over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Investment options &ndash;</strong> Check that there are options to suit your needs and preferred level of risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Extra benefits &ndash;</strong> Some employers pay more than the minimum contributions through certain funds.</li>\n<li><strong>Insurance &ndash;</strong> Check what coverage is available and the cost.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer service &ndash;</strong> Look for a fund that can offer support when you need it. Some funds charge a fee for offering financial advice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure you are comparing funds accurately by checking that details such as the investment returns period and fee period match up. For example, a 10-year average return for the period ending 30 June is different from a 10-year average return for the period ending 31 December. Similarly, one fund may charge fees annually, while another may charge them monthly.</p>\n<p>When comparing investment returns, also make sure your comparison is based on the investment option you want to invest in &ndash; growth, balanced, conservative or cash.</p>\n<h3><strong>Where to find information about super funds</strong></h3>\n<p>You can usually find information about performance, investment options, fees and so on by looking at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The super fund&rsquo;s website</li>\n<li>The product disclosure statement</li>\n<li>A <span><a href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/superannuation"">super comparison tool</a></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve looked at the features and long-term performance of a variety of funds, you&rsquo;ll be in a good position to decide which are the best performing super funds for your circumstances.</p>\n<h3><strong>Should you change super funds?</strong></h3>\n<p>Deciding whether or not to change super funds depends on whether you&rsquo;re happy with how your current fund is performing. Keep in mind that market fluctuations can be expected with most investments, so it&rsquo;s not necessarily worth jumping ship at the first sight of a downturn.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve compared your options and think there is a better fund out there to suit your circumstances, here are a few more things to consider before switching:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insurance &ndash;</strong> Some funds provide insurance such as life insurance or income protection insurance. If you switch funds, you might lose current coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Switching fees &ndash;</strong> Your current fund may charge a fee for switching.</li>\n<li><strong>Tax payable &ndash;</strong> There may be capital gains tax to pay as a result of rolling over your funds. Before switching, check with your super fund what your estimated closing balance will be.</li>\n<li><strong>New investment options &ndash;</strong> Make sure you are happy with the investment options available from your new chosen fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>How to transfer or consolidate superannuation funds</strong></h3>\n<p>Depending on which fund you&rsquo;ve chosen, you may be able to transfer your money to a new fund online during the sign-up process. You&rsquo;ll also need to change your fund with the ATO, either at the myGov website or by filling out a rollover initiation request form.</p>\n<p>If you have money in more than one super fund, consolidating into a single account can make it easier to manage your investments and reduce the fees you need to pay.</p>\n<p>The consolidation process works in much the same way as transferring funds, except you&rsquo;ll need to transfer funds from more than one account. You can also search for lost super via the myGov website.</p>\n<p>Once you have consolidated or transferred your super into a new account, make sure to let your employer know the details of your new fund.</p>",,5,0,3,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.95,541.0

Probably because it seems more complex than it actually is. </span></p>\n<p><span>To be a good money manager requires you to periodically assess your finances. And evaluate whether your current financial position is benefitting you in the short and long term.</span></p>\n<p><span>Your superannuation account shouldn&rsquo;t escape the same scrutiny that you would place your credit card or home loan under.</span></p>\n<p><span>With the variety of superannuation funds out there, it&rsquo;s important that you choose (or re-choose) your superannuation fund wisely. Because you can!</span></p>\n<p><span>To analyse what&rsquo;s the best superannuation fund for you, a good starting place is your current fund. When was the last time you examined your quarterly or annual statement? </span></p>\n<p><span>When looking at your statement, or looking for a superannuation fund to invest with, there are some easy items to consider which will help with your decision:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Fees:</span></strong><span> what are the administration and fund management fees?</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Investment options:</span></strong><span> does the fund offer Australian or international shares, cash, bonds, property or a mix of all?</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Track record:</span></strong><span> how long has the fund existed and what returns has it recorded for members?</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Insurance:</span></strong><span> can you take out life or income protection insurance? Is it more competitive than your current provider? </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Other services:</span></strong><span> does the fund offer additional services such as financial planning and advice?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>These factors will help to narrow down what you&rsquo;re looking for in a superannuation fund based on your needs. From here, you can go even further and pick a fund based on what type of fund it is. </span></p>\n<h3>What type of superannuation funds are there?</h3>\n<p><span>The following list is a snapshot of the type of funds that exist in Australia (of course, this list is subject to change):</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Retail funds</span></strong><span> are usually owned and operated by banks or investment companies. Anyone can join a retail fund.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Public sector funds</span></strong><span> were created for federal, state, and local government employees. Some public-sector funds accept members who are not public servants. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Industry funds</span></strong><span> generally represent employees from specific industry sectors such as manufacturing or hospitality. Many industry funds accept members from outside their industry.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Corporate funds</span></strong><span> are privately owned and operated by an employer specifically for its employees. You need to be an employee to be a member of this type of fund.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>MySuper</span></strong><span> is a default superannuation account where employers can make contributions on behalf of an employee. This is a no-fills account that does not offer defined benefits. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Self-managed funds</span></strong><span> are controlled by you. Also referred to as SMSF accounts, self-managed funds require a thorough understanding of superannuation and investing to manage. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>When choosing a superannuation fund, you can decide based on your occupation or industry, or perhaps you want a fund that&rsquo;s in line with your values. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Many superannuation funds represent specific interest groups and advocate for certain principles. For example, you can choose a fund that invests in renewable energy or one that donates a percentage of profits to charity. </span></p>\n<h3>How do I change superannuation funds?</h3>\n<p><span>Now that you&rsquo;ve considered whether you want, say, a retail fund run by one of the big banks or a not-for-profit industry fund that gives profits back to members, what next?</span></p>\n<p><span>Most superannuation funds let you open an account online or over the phone. This step is relatively straight-forward, although you will need your tax file number on hand for this process. </span></p>\n<p><span>Once you&rsquo;re up and running, you may need to rollover any existing superannuation accounts to the new fund. There a couple of ways you can do this:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Find out if your new super fund will do this for you (in most cases they will)</span></li>\n<li><span>Rollover your existing account/s yourself via the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://my.gov.au/"">MyGov</a> portal (you will need to have the Australian Taxation Office linked to your profile)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Voila! All done. </span></p>\n<h3>What is the superannuation guarantee?</h3>\n<p><span>The superannuation guarantee is the term given to compulsory superannuation contributions made by employers to complying superannuation funds. </span></p>\n<p><span>From 1 July 2014, the federal government stipulated that an employer must contribute 9.5 per cent (as the minimum) of an employee&rsquo;s wage or salary to their superannuation, although this is scheduled to gradually rise to 12 per cent by 2025.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>How much superannuation do I need to retire? </span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>There are many equations available for this question, but generally speaking the amount of super you will retire with is calculated on your average earnings throughout your career. </span></p>\n<p><span>How much you need is dependent on what retirement lifestyle you want. If luxury travel is part of your retirement plan, you might need to make extra contributions yourself to achieve this goal. </span></p>\n<p><span>To help you determine your retirement tally, you can refer to peak body organisations such as the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.superannuation.asn.au/"">Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia</a> to help with your projections.</span></p>",,880,25,358,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,154.2,194.0

By making your nominations binding, the trustee of your superannuation account must distribute the funds accordingly.</p>\n<p>Who you choose as a beneficiary is governed by law, so ensure you understand who you can leave your death benefit too in the first instance.</p>\n<p>The Superannuation Industry Supervision Act dictates that benefits can be paid only to your estate or people deemed to be your dependents.</p>\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the difference between a binding and non-binding nomination?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A binding nomination</strong> means the trustee of your superannuation fund must pay any death benefits to the beneficiaries you&rsquo;ve nominated.</li>\n<li><strong>A non-binding nomination</strong> means the trustee of your superannuation fund can decide how your death benefits are distributed according to the law (e.g. pay the benefits directly to your estate).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Do I have to make a binding nomination?</h3>\n<p>A binding death benefit nomination is not compulsory. You can still add beneficiaries to your superannuation account without the need for any binding nominations.</p>\n<p>In the event of your death, only people legally considered to be your dependents can receive funds from your superannuation balance and any life insurance held in the fund.</p>\n<h3>What are the types of binding nominations available?</h3>\n<p><span>There are two choices of </span>binding death benefit nomination. One is lapsing; the other is a non-lapsing nomination. One has an expiry date; the other is valid in perpetuity. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you opt for a binding death benefit nomination but don&rsquo;t choose either lapsing or non-lapsing, the default option is lapsing (which lasts for three years), so this is a detail to look out for when applying.</p>\n<p>A non-lapsing binding death benefit nomination (depending on your fund&rsquo;s rules) is valid up until your death, although it can be amended or revoked by you at any time beforehand. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>How do I apply for a binding nomination?</h3>\n<p><span>Speak directly to your superannuation fund about obtaining a binding death benefit nomination. </span></p>\n<h3>How long are binding nominations valid?</h3>\n<p><span>Binding nominations are valid for only three years from the date of signing, amending or confirming, after which time your super fund will prompt you to renew nominations. </span></p>\n<p><span>This presents an opportunity to re-evaluate who you&rsquo;ve nominated as a beneficiary and add a new family member or remove an ex-spouse, for example. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you no longer wanted a binding nomination, then you would simply let the nominations lapse. </span></p>\n<p><span>Binding nominations for self-managed superannuation funds (SMSF) do not expire after three years. If you have an SMSF, a binding nomination can remain in force in perpetuity.</span></p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

This means that your employer must make compulsory superannuation contributions to the value of 9.5 per cent of your salary or wage into your nominated super fund.</p>\n<h3>What is superannuation?</h3>\n<p>In Australia, superannuation contributions are compulsory for all employers. In 1992, the Australian government made superannuation mandatory for all Australians. Regardless of where you live in Brisbane or around Australia, if you&rsquo;re an Australian citizen employed and working in Australia, your employer must currently legally contribute 9.5 per cent of your annual salary into your nominated superfund each quarter. The government has plans to increase the current superannuation rate on a sliding scale to 12 per cent by 2025.</p>\n<p>Before superannuation was compulsory in Australia, retirees relied on their savings and a government pension to help them maintain their quality of life. With the population now living approximately 20 years longer in retirement, superannuation is becoming an increasingly important income source for retirees in Brisbane and all across Australia. Accumulating enough superannuation over your working life is key to maintaining your quality of life in retirement and reducing your reliance on the government pension.</p>\n<h3>What to look for in a superannuation fund?</h3>\n<p>Planning for retirement is something that all Australians, including those who live in Brisbane, should start thinking about at the beginning of their working life. It might seem futile to plan for something that&rsquo;s 30 or even 40 years away, but superannuation accumulates over time and getting it right is crucial for a comfortable retirement.

Depending on your industry and employment, not all of these options will be available to you. Retail funds are for-profit funds that usually have shareholders and are mostly run by banks. Industry super funds were originally set up for workers from a specific industry, but are now open to all Australians, including those who live and work in Brisbane. Government funds are mostly aimed at federal or state government employees, and corporate funds are usually organised specifically by an employer for its employees. Depending on how much super you&rsquo;ve accumulated, you also have the option of opening a self-managed super fund.</p>\n<p>The type of superannuation fund you choose ultimately depends on your financial situation, the industry you work in and your overall life circumstances.

Usually an employer will pay money into a superannuation account at least once per quarter. The aim is for this money to grow and grow throughout your working life, so you can fund a comfortable retirement in Canberra or elsewhere.</p>\n<h3>What superannuation funds are open to people in Canberra?</h3>\n<p>Superannuation is a national scheme that aims to benefit all working Australians. No matter if you live in Canberra or Queanbeyan or elsewhere in the country, you will have access to all the same superannuation funds.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, superannuation funds aim to do roughly similar things. That goal is to collect money for your retirement. There are heaps of superannuation funds for you to choose from so you should consider all your options.</p>\n<p>A significant proportion of the Canberra population works in the public service. If you&rsquo;re a public servant, you might want to go for a special public service superannuation fund. They&rsquo;re open only to members of the public service and offer differ benefits to other super funds.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got some time on your hands, you might want to look into a self-managed super fund. It puts you in the driving seat of your superannuation by allowing you to make your own investment decisions. However, it requires more effort &ndash; and financial competence &ndash; to manage, so it&rsquo;s not for everyone.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;d prefer to delegate your investment decisions to a professional manager, you could put it in a retail superannuation fund. They are run for a profit, charge medium to high fees and tend to offer a large variety of options on investments.</p>\n<p>An alternative to retail super funds is industry superannuation funds. They are not-for-profit entities that often have historical connections to particular industries. Industry funds invest their money back into the superannuation funds, so members receive more benefits.</p>\n<h3>How do I choose the right superannuation fund?</h3>\n<p>Choosing the right superannuation fund is a bit like choosing which Canberra restaurant to visit. It all depends on your specific tastes and financial position.</p>\n<p>So you need to assess your current financial situation as well as young long-term financial goals. In other words, you need to consider what kind of superannuation account fits with your working life and your career.</p>\n<p>Choosing a superannuation fund is a very important decision, whether you live in Canberra or elsewhere, so it pays to do your research before you settle on a provider.</p>",,10,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.0,522.0

Superannuation can generally be relied upon as a nest egg for retirees&mdash;the earlier you start earning a wage, the more your employers will have contributed to your super fund over your lifetime, meaning the more you will be able to spend in your retirement.</p>\n<p>Under Australian law, all employees of companies and organisations much be paid a superannuation contribution, currently at the minimum rate of 9.5 per cent of your total income. This is known as the &lsquo;super guarantee&rsquo;.</p>\n<h3>Casual employment and superannuation</h3>\n<p>Though casual employees might not be entitled to some benefits permanent employees are granted, they must be paid superannuation. ASIC states that &ldquo;Your employer must pay 9.5 per cent of the value of your 'ordinary time earnings' into your super fund if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You're over 18 and earn more than $450 before tax in a calendar month</li>\n<li>You're under 18 and work more than 30 hours a week (and still earn more than $450 in the calendar month)&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, if you&rsquo;re a casual employee who works extra hours once in a while, your employer must adjust their superannuation payment accordingly. How often your superannuation is paid will depend on your company, but it should be done at least quarterly. If you would like to boost your superannuation, consider making voluntary contributions. Those who are on lower incomes might qualify for the government&rsquo;s co-contribution scheme.</p>\n<h3>Choosing your super fund</h3>\n<p>Many employers have a default superannuation fund, but you can generally opt for your employer to pay your superannuation into a fund of your choice. Conducting thorough research before choosing your super fund can be advantageous, as you will rely heavily on your super fund during your retirement.</p>\n<p>There are several types of super funds you could choose from, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Industry funds</strong>&nbsp;are super funds which were originally established for the purpose of catering to employees in various industries, but are now usually open to everybody</li>\n<li><strong>Retail funds</strong>&nbsp;are managed by banks or insurance companies</li>\n<li><strong>Corporate funds</strong>&nbsp;are generally managed by employers or companies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternatively, you might choose a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF). In order to do this, you must register the fund with the ATO. During this process, you will also be able to elect for your fund to be regulated, apply for a tax file number and Australian Business Number, and register for GST as well.</p>\n<p>Once you choose your super fund, your employer might ask you to fill out the ATO&rsquo;s standard choice form, in order for them to organise your super payments.</p>\n<h3>Things to look out for</h3>\n<p>Shopping around for suitable options and conducting comparisons will be beneficial when choosing your super fund. Some things to take note of include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The fund&rsquo;s track record and member reviews</li>\n<li>Fees associated with the super fund</li>\n<li>If the fund offers life insurance and disability cover</li>\n<li>In the fund offers investment options suitable for your comfort with risk</li>\n<li>Any additional services the fund can offer</li>\n</ul>",,390,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,39.0,283.0

Often, you enter the workforce with little knowledge of what funds offer, which is why many people go along with their employer&rsquo;s preferred choice.</p>\n<p>However, as you move between jobs,&nbsp;you have the tricky task of choosing between these two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stay with your original super fund</li>\n<li>Switch to a fund that better represents your new employment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So how do you know whether to stay or switch? And, more importantly, how do you determine which super fund is most suitable to your industry and needs?</p>\n<h3>What is a super fund?</h3>\n<p>A super fund is where your superannuation, or &lsquo;super, is stored. This money is accumulated over your working life to act as savings for your retirement. Super is built up in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your employer makes contributions on your behalf</li>\n<li>You bump it up with lump sums of your own money</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You generally join a super fund as soon as you enter the workforce &ndash; and your employer will have a recommended fund.</p>\n<h3>What is a self-managed super fund?</h3>\n<p>Australians may choose to put their superannuation into a self-managed super fund (or SMSF). The trustees are responsible for making super contributions to other members of the fund, and complying with tax and super laws.</p>\n<h3>Are there different types of super funds?</h3>\n<p>There are several hundred super funds in Australia, which can make the comparison task a little daunting. The good news is, there are only five main types, and most Australian workers can only choose from three of them.</p>\n<p>Available to most Australians:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retail funds</li>\n<li>Industry funds</li>\n<li>Self-managed super funds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The other two types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Public sector funds (government schemes)</li>\n<li>Company (or corporate) funds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Public sector and company funds are generally only available to people who are part of the public sector or relevant company.</p>\n<h3>How do you compare funds? And what should you look for?</h3>\n<p>It never hurts to seek professional advice before comparing super funds. However, these are a few considerations to help you get started:</p>\n<p><strong>Rankings: </strong>Online superannuation ratings agencies allow you to compare how your existing fund ranks against others you may be considering joining.

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Superannuation that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p><span>Superannuation is one of the most important investments you will make in life. Strangely, though, many Australians don&rsquo;t give super a lot of thought. </span></p>\n<p><span>As the government continues to raise the age pension qualifying age, many of us will face the prospect of a self-funded retirement. The good news is the superannuation industry is responding by becoming increasingly competitive and you can often find a better deal. </span></p>\n<p><span>We&rsquo;re going to look at the importance of superannuation comparison, and how comparing super funds can help give you the edge in retirement. </span></p>\n<h3>What is superannuation?</h3>\n<p><span>Superannuation is designed as a strategy to accumulate enough funds in your working days to provide you with a steady income in retirement. </span></p>\n<p><span>Your super balance grows through compulsory contributions from your employer, which you can supplement through voluntary contributions and salary sacrifice arrangements. Your funds will be pooled with those of other members, and will be managed by professional investors with a view to grow it steadily and provide solid returns, no matter how the market is performing. </span></p>\n<p><span>In most cases you will not be able to access your superannuation funds until you&rsquo;ve reached the point of retirement. </span></p>\n<h3>Why is it important to compare super funds?</h3>\n<p><span>Superannuation is by no means a one-size-fits-all prospect, and there are many advantages to testing the market and seeing if there is a product that better suits your financial needs. </span></p>\n<p><span>Super funds can vary greatly in terms of fees and projected returns on investments. It&rsquo;s also important to consider the add-ons you may qualify for when joining a super fund, including death, disability and income protection insurance. </span></p>\n<p><span>Taking these factors into consideration when you compare your superannuation with other options is the best way to ensure you&rsquo;re getting bang for your buck, or realise that perhaps it&rsquo;s time to start looking elsewhere. </span></p>\n<h3>What should you look for when comparing superannuation?</h3>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re comparing super funds, it&rsquo;s important to have your retirement goals in mind. Superannuation comparison requires you taking a variety of factors into consideration, and little details can make a big difference in terms of your overall retirement outlook. </span></p>\n<p><span>For instance, one fund might seem like a good option because if offers low administration fees. But it might not have the additional extras other funds possess, and it might offer a lower rate of return for members.</span></p>\n<p><span>Here are some things to consider when comparing super funds:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance</strong> &ndash; While it shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, annualised returns from previous years at least gives you an idea as to how the super fund has tracked in the past against competitors. RateCity makes it simple to compare a range of super funds by performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Fees</strong> &ndash; Superannuation accounts incur a range of fees that could impact your overall balance. These could include administration fees, advice fees, indirect costs and insurance premiums. The amount and size of these fees varies from fund to fund, so it&rsquo;s important you&rsquo;re comfortable with the fees you&rsquo;re paying. If you&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s time to test the market.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional extras</strong> &ndash; The superannuation industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with many funds looking to entice new members with added extras. These could include anything from advisory services to insurance, income protections and online access. When comparing super funds, it&rsquo;s important to take the additional extras into account.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span><br /> Are there different types of superannuation funds?</span></h3>\n<p><span>When it comes to super there are quite a lot of options, with multiple fund types available for people looking to shore up their retirement income. </span></p>\n<p><span>When you&rsquo;re comparing super funds, it&rsquo;s important to be aware of these fund types, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. This makes it easier to choose a fund that represents the best option for you. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Industry funds</strong> &ndash; These funds are not-for-profit entities, set up purely for the benefit of members. While many industry funds are now open to all members of the public, they were once exclusively tied to a profession (such as doctors, lawyers, etc). Industry funds generally offer simple options, so you&rsquo;re not charged for extras you don&rsquo;t need.</li>\n<li><strong>Retail funds</strong> &ndash; These funds are run for the profit of shareholders. The companies that own these funds intend to retain a degree of profit, but they&rsquo;re open to everyone and generally come with a lot of investment options.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-managed super funds (SMSFs)</strong> &ndash; After the global financial crisis (GFC), self-managed super funds took off in Australia, as many super owners saw their traditional funds dwindle. SMSFs are more difficult to manage, but they can offer certain advantages. With an SMSF, you control the investment directly, opening a greater number of investment options to increase your retirement savings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Is it possible to change funds?</h3>\n<p><span>Many people in Australia miss an opportunity to maximise their retirement savings by failing to test the market and see what other super options are out there. Changing superannuation funds, or consolidating multiple funds into the one account, has the potential to maximise your savings, however there are some important factors to be aware of. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Termination fees</strong> &ndash; Many funds have termination fees that will be incurred if you look to change funds. Before making the decision to change funds, it&rsquo;s important that you are aware of any such fees so you can make an informed decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Levels of insurance</strong> &ndash; Different superannuation funds offer different levels of insurance, and it&rsquo;s important that the fund you&rsquo;re moving to offers a level that is in line with your expectations. If not, you may find yourself under-insured or over-insured.</li>\n<li><strong>Can your employer pay</strong> &ndash; If you&rsquo;re planning to jump ship to another fund, it&rsquo;s important that your employer is made aware of this, and can make contributions to the new fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span><br /> How much superannuation will I need to retire?</span></h3>\n<p><span>This is one of the big questions in life facing many Australians, and while the numbers have been crunched there really is no simple answer. When putting a number to a ballpark figure, you need to consider not only how long you will live after finishing work, but also what type of lifestyle you want, and any future medical costs on the horizon. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia&rsquo;s (ASFA) figures for March 2017 suggest the lump sum required to support a comfortable lifestyle is $640,000 for a couple and $545,000 for a single person, assuming some partial drawing of the age pension. But this figure may not be in line with what you want out of retirement. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to compare super funds and make sure the one you&rsquo;re contributing to is best place to meet your retirement goals. </span></p>\n<h3>I&rsquo;m ready to start comparing funds. What&rsquo;s next?</h3>\n<p><span>If you feel like you could be getting a better deal elsewhere, it&rsquo;s time to test the market. RateCity makes it easy to compare superannuation funds so you can be sure you&rsquo;re in the best position to enjoy retirement on your terms, once your working days are over.</span></p>",,1300,0,5,2,80,0.6,0.125,0.125,0.75,0.75,1035.875,99.0

This is by no means a simple solution however, and one that should be undertaken with upmost caution. </span></p>\n<p><span>We&rsquo;re going to look at superannuation can be used to help meet debt from your credit cards in extreme situations, and why you should be wary before undertaking this process. </span></p>\n<h3>When can I access my super?</h3>\n<p><span>In most cases, you are not able to access your super until you&rsquo;ve reached your preservation age, which is determined by the year you were born. Once you&rsquo;ve reached the preservation age, you can access your superannuation provided you meet the following criteria:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>You have retired &ndash;</span></strong><span> If you have permanently retired and met the superannuation perseveration age, you&rsquo;re legally allowed to access your super funds. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>You&rsquo;re semi-retired &ndash;</span></strong><span> If you&rsquo;re working part-time, it&rsquo;s possible to access part of your super through a transition-to-retirement pension offered by some funds. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>When can I access my super early?</h3>\n<p><span>In some cases, you might wish to access part of your super before you have reached the superannuation perseveration age and met the eligibility criteria.

With people now living longer in retirement, superannuation is becoming an increasingly important source of income and support for retirees. Having adequate superannuation is important for maintaining quality of life and having minimal reliance on the government pension.</p>\n<p>Since 1992, it&rsquo;s been compulsory in Australia for an employer to make superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees. Known as the Superannuation Guarantee, the current superannuation contribution rate is 9.5 per cent of an employee&rsquo;s wage or salary. Regardless of the size of the company, an employer is legally required to contribute 9.5 per cent of an employee&rsquo;s salary to their nominated superfund each quarter.</p>\n<p>The current superannuation rate of 9.5 per cent has been in place since 1 July 2014 and is scheduled to increase on a sliding scale to 12 per cent by 2025.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re 18 or over, employed and earning over $450 before tax each calendar month, your employer must make compulsory superannuation contributions, using the current superannuation rate of 9.5 per cent on your behalf.</p>\n<p>Employees under 18 working over 30 hours each week and earning more than $450 before tax each calendar month will also be paid super under the current superannuation rates.</p>\n<p>If the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) deem you a contractor, your employer will also need to make super payments for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is superannuation?</strong></h3>\n<p>Superannuation is essentially a tax-effective investment portfolio that ensures you have enough money available to you when you retire. The main aim of superannuation is to provide a source of income to retirees and reduce reliance on the government age pension.</p>\n<p>Depending on the type of superannuation fund you choose, super generally works by pooling your money together with other members. That money is then managed and invested on your behalf by a professional investment manager where it presumably increases steadily over many years until you&rsquo;re ready to retire. When you do retire, you can choose to withdraw your super as one lump sum, or opt to receive regular payments known as an income stream.</p>\n<p>Based on the current superannuation rates, your employer will make contributions to your specified super fund. You can also choose to top up your super balance using your own money, and the government may make some contributions to your super account if you&rsquo;re a low- or middle-income earner.</p>\n<p>Outside of funding retirement, superannuation also has some other advantages. Most superannuation funds will give its members access to cheaper insurance policies such as life, disability and income protection cover. These policies are often cheaper because super funds purchase insurance policies in bulk.</p>\n<p>The other major benefit is that any additional contributions you make to your superannuation fund out of pre-tax income are taxed at a lower rate, making this an attractive and tax-effective investment.</p>\n<h3><strong>Contributing in addition to the current superannuation rates</strong></h3>\n<p>Relying solely on the superannuation guarantee contribution at the current superannuation rates may not provide you with enough to retire comfortably.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a low-income earner or have worked out that your super will need an extra boost, you can supplement the current superannuation rate by making concessional contributions from your pre-tax income.</p>\n<p>You can also make non-concessional contributions which come from your post-tax salary.</p>\n<p>There are limits on the amount of additional contributions you can make to your super account. Contributions you do make in addition to the current superannuation rates generally can&rsquo;t be accessed until you hit retirement age.</p>\n<p>Before you make any decisions, it&rsquo;s always best to do your research to find the best superannuation fund for you.</p>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

Choosing the right super fund can mean the difference between having good or great quality of life in your retirement years, so it pays to do your research.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What should I know about Darwin?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>As superannuation is a form of investment, it&rsquo;s important to consider the economy in Darwin when choosing the most competitive super fund for your financial needs.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Like the rest of the Northern Territory, Darwin&rsquo;s economy is built upon the mining and tourism industries, as well as being dependent on the government sector. However, experts believe this dependence makes it highly prone to volatility once large investments wind down. <br /> </span></p>\n<p><span>Employment conditions in Darwin are mixed, but tourism continues to play a huge role in creating new employment opportunities. The city is a popular waterfront area surrounded by beaches, museums and art, and is a gateway to Kakadu National Park.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The Northern Territory has Australia&rsquo;s highest proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (25.5 per cent of the population). Darwin has a large population of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people descended from various tribal groups including Larrakia, Kunwinjku, Arrernte, Gun-djeihmi and Jawoyn.<br /> </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Choosing a superannuation fund in Darwin</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Each superannuation fund in Darwin will charge different fees, offer different insurances and investment options and have different performances histories. RateCity experts believe you should ask the following questions when comparing superannuation funds:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>What fees are involved?</span></li>\n<li><span>What insurances are available?</span></li>\n<li><span>What investment options are offered?</span></li>\n<li><span>How risky are these investment options? </span></li>\n<li><span>Will these investment options match my financial needs?</span></li>\n<li><span>How have these investment options performed historically?</span>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>How much should my employer pay into my super fund? </strong></h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in the Darwin area, choosing a superannuation fund is a simple process. Australia&rsquo;s superannuation system is built upon the Super Guarantee, in which employers must pay a percentage of an employer&rsquo;s earnings into their allocated super fund. This percentage amount is currently 9.5 per cent.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>What does this mean for superannuation in Darwin?</strong></h3>\n<p><span>According to the Super Guarantee, there is a $450 monthly income threshold that employees must earn before employers are legally entitled to pay their super. Many superannuation groups, including the Indigenous Superannuation Working Group (ISWG) have called for an end to this threshold. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Due to the large population of Indigenous people in Darwin, and the weekly household income for Australian and Torres Strait Islander adults being almost half that of other Australian adults, this threshold is resulting in many Indigenous people receiving less money in retirement.&nbsp; <br /> </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>What government super assistance is available?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you can&rsquo;t reach this income threshold, it&rsquo;s worth considering government superannuation assistance for those with low income levels.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>If you are on a lower income, you may be eligible for the Low Income Superannuation Tax Offset (LISTO). LISTO refunds up to $500 of the tax paid on concessional (before-tax) super contributions for workers with a yearly income of up to $37,000. The benefit is paid directly to your super fund.</span></p>",,20,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,2.0,473.5

You have good reason to! Your superannuation fund will be one of the most ‰ÛÒ if not the most ‰ÛÒ important sources of income for you when you retire, so it‰Ûªs a good idea to start thinking about it as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Here are a few things to consider when superannuation financial planning.</p>\n<h3>What is superannuation?</h3>\n<p>Superannuation is a fund for your retirement. Your employer makes compulsory contributions to your superannuation with every pay cheque; you might also want to make your own additional contributions to ensure you have enough money to fund a comfortable retirement. This is where superannuation financial planning can be helpful.</p>\n<p>The money in your superannuation account is invested on your behalf by the super fund. The goal is to grow your superannuation so that it has a healthy balance by the time you retire.</p>\n<h3>Could I have more than one superannuation fund?</h3>\n<p>If you have held more than one jobåÊin your life ‰ÛÒ including part-time and casual jobs ‰ÛÒ then the answer is yes. Many people may have more than one super fund without realising it, as they may have started a new job and inadvertently signed up for a new super fund.</p>\n<p>If you are signed up with more than one super fund, you‰Ûªll have to pay multiple sets of fees and manage multiple accounts. For these reasons, one step that some people recommend when it comes to superannuation financial planning is to consolidate your super funds.</p>\n<h3>What should I look for in a superannuation fund?</h3>\n<p>If you do, in fact, have a few super funds floating around, you might be unsure which one to choose and consolidate your other funds into. It‰Ûªs easy to default to your employer‰Ûªs preferred fund, but this will not necessarily help you to plan for your retirement.

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Superannuation that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p>Superannuation death cover (also known as life cover) is a type of life insurance cover. It pays a specified amount of money (or benefit) when you die. The money goes to whoever you have nominated as beneficiaries on the policy. If you don&rsquo;t nominate anyone, a trustee or your estate will decide where the money goes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The amount of the benefit paid is the money in your super account at the time of death, plus any life insurance cover through your super fund.</p>\n<h3>Isn&rsquo;t my super covered by my will?</h3>\n<p>Generally, your will only covers the things you own, for example your house, car and other personal items. It can also include savings accounts, shares and investments.</p>\n<p>However, your super is different because it is held in trust for you by the trustee of your super fund. Superannuation is also governed by specific laws and regulations, so you need to stay up to date with your instructions to your super fund regarding your wishes.</p>\n<h3>Who gets my death benefit?</h3>\n<p>Upon your death, your super fund <span><a href=""https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/glossary/t/trustee-(super-fund)"">trustee</a></span> usually pays your death benefit to one or more of your dependants or to your estate. In this case, 'dependants' includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your spouse (including de facto and same-sex de facto partners)</li>\n<li>Your children</li>\n<li>People who depend on you financially</li>\n<li>People you&rsquo;ve had an interdependency relationship with</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An 'interdependency relationship' exists if two people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a close personal relationship</li>\n<li>Live together</li>\n<li>Provide each other with financial support or domestic support and personal care</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most super funds will let you nominate the people you want your death benefit paid to, by making either a binding or a non-binding nomination.</p>\n<p>A binding nomination means that your super fund trustee has no choice about who gets your death benefit funds because you have already made the decision. The money can go to either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One or more of your dependants</li>\n<li>Your personal legal representative, who must pay out the money according to your <span><a href=""https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/glossary/w/will"">will</a></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A non-binding nomination gives some guidance to the super fund trustee on who will get your super benefits, but they are not required to follow the instructions in your will. The trustee has the final say, especially if you nominate someone who doesn't depend on you. You might make a non-binding when you think your circumstances may change (for example having a child, or more children) or separating from your partner.</p>\n<p>If you don't nominate anyone, the trustee will decide who your money goes to. This is not ideal, because it can result in delays and arguments among your family about who should get the money.</p>\n<h3>How is the death benefit paid?</h3>\n<p>There are two ways for superannuation death benefits to be paid: as a lump sum or as an income stream.</p>\n<p>If your beneficiaries are dependants, the death benefit can be paid as either a lump sum or an income stream. However, if the beneficiaries are not dependants, then they must have the benefit paid as a lump sum.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of having superannuation death cover?</h3>\n<p>The pros of having superannuation death cover are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cover through your super fund can be cheaper than stand-alone life insurance.</li>\n<li>It may be easier to manage your cash flow since the premiums will be deducted from your superannuation account rather than your bank balance</li>\n<li>Most superannuation funds will not require a medical examination for standard cover (although one may be required if you want a higher level of cover)</li>\n<li>Super policies may also include total and permanent disablement (TPD) and/or income protection insurance</li>\n<li>If you arrange to salary sacrifice the cost of the premiums instead of having them deducted from you superannuation account balance, there may be tax benefits</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the cons of having superannuation death cover?</h3>\n<p>The cons of having superannuation death cover are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Super fund insurance may not give the same degree of cover, or enough cover to effectively protect you and your family</li>\n<li>You need to make a binding nomination to be sure your money goes where you want it to, otherwise a trustee may decide it should go somewhere else</li>\n<li>The death benefit payouts have to go through your superannuation fund before they go to your beneficiaries, meaning there can be a delay in the benefit being paid. If you have made a non-binding nomination or none at all, the process will be delayed while the trustee determines the correct beneficiary</li>\n<li>If you have the premiums deducted from your super account, it means you have less money to be invested and maybe less when you retire (although you can make personal additional contributions to offset this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, the best idea is to explore all the options, to decide whether superannuation death benefit is the best fit for you and your circumstances, both now and in the long term.</p>",,10,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,1.0,522.0

The standard insurances offered by most superannuation funds are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death cover (or life insurance)</li>\n<li>Total and permanent disability (TPD)</li>\n<li>Income protection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any other types of insurance policy are offered at the discretion of the fund. So, if you want to consolidate all your insurances with your super, you&rsquo;ll have to find a fund that insures health.</p>\n<p>This presents a golden opportunity to shop around and compare your current fund and it&rsquo;s offering against the competition.</p>\n<p>Many super funds offer health insurance policies as a fringe benefit to members among other discounted products and services.</p>\n<p>With so many super funds competing for members these days, it means that you as a prospective member have the opportunity to get more benefit out of your super fund than ever before.</p>\n<h3><strong>What&rsquo;s the benefit of buying health insurance through a super fund?</strong></h3>\n<p>Convenience would be the major benefit of attempting to keep all your insurance policies under the one roof, where the recurring payments for premiums can be deducted from your super balance.</p>\n<p>Your goal might be to organise all your insurance policies &ndash; life/death, TPD and income protection plus health &ndash; so that they&rsquo;re managed by your super fund. After all, that&rsquo;s partly why you pay management fees.</p>\n<p>Another good reason to take out a health insurance policy through your super fund is for the discount.

And it&rsquo;s important to stress the difference between life and health insurance. Because both are very different policies!</p>\n<p>The difference between the two types of insurance basically comes down to this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health insurance is against the risk of hospitalisation and medical expenses</li>\n<li>Life insurance is against the risk of death.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the moment in Australia, there is only a handful of industry funds offering health insurance in addition to superannuation accounts.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do I choose the best health insurance policy?</strong></h3>\n<p>As you would do if you were considering any health insurance policy, you would make sure your superannuation health insurance policy has the inclusions and level of cover you need.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re transferring super funds to one that offers health insurance, check whether a medical examination is required.</p>\n<p>Some super funds do not require medical examinations for life insurance policies, but this may not be the case for health insurance policies.</p>\n<p>This is particularly important if you or a member of your family has any pre-existing conditions.</p>",,5,0,3,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.95,541.0

For this reason, it&rsquo;s worth taking the time to understand the different super investment options available in Australia. Here&rsquo;s a guide to get you started.</p>\n<h3>What assets can I invest superannuation in?</h3>\n<p>Investment assets fall into four classes: shares, property, fixed interest and cash.</p>\n<p>One difference between each asset class is how much financial risk they come with. Shares and property are considered &lsquo;growth assets&rsquo;: they come with a higher risk of loss compared to fixed interest and cash, but generally offer better returns over time. Cash and fixed interest offer stable returns with less risk. Super funds often call them &lsquo;defensive assets&rsquo;, as they aim to protect your super from loss.</p>\n<h3>Who chooses which assets my super is invested in?</h3>\n<p>Super fund trustees invest your money into different assets, based on the investment strategy you choose.</p>\n<p>Most funds offer different investment &lsquo;options&rsquo; you can select from. Based on a combination of assets, each option offers a certain level of risk and expected growth. For example, a &lsquo;growth option&rsquo; may invest 85 per cent of your super in shares and property to produce higher-than-average returns; a &lsquo;conservative option&rsquo; may invest most of your super in fixed interest and cash to reduce the risk of loss; a &lsquo;moderate&rsquo; option may aim for a balance between the two.</p>\n<h3>I want more control over my investments. What about an SMSF?</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, a self-managed super fund (SMSF) is a fund where you are a trustee with complete control over how your super is invested.</p>\n<p>Along with ensuring the SMSF meets Australian regulatory requirements, trustees develop and implement their fund&rsquo;s personal investment strategy. This makes an SMSF an appealing option for those who want more control over how their super is invested.</p>\n<h3>Investing your super in Australian shares</h3>\n<p>One common option people take with superannuation investments is Australian shares. Often driven by the big banks and mining companies, Australian shares are historically strong performers with a good track record.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind that some periods of negative returns are expected if you invest in Australian shares over a long period of time. Pros and cons of investing your super in Australian shares include:</p>\n<h3>Pros of investment in Australian shares</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A familiar market makes it easier to monitor share performance</li>\n<li>Shares are a liquid asset, easy to sell when needed</li>\n<li>Although negative returns are expected over the short term, shares can offer substantial growth over an investment time-frame of more than 10 years</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons of investment in Australian shares</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased risk compared to fixed income assets, as share prices can fall</li>\n<li>Some prefer to invest in global shares for potentially higher returns</li>\n<li>Share values fluctuate, so your dividend may vary month to month</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Can I change my investment allocation?</h3>\n<p>It is common to adjust your investment strategy as your life stage changes, whether it&rsquo;s to take on more risk for higher returns, or to protect your capital as you approach retirement.</p>\n<p>Most super funds in Australia let you reallocate some, or all, of your super into a different investment option over the phone or online. Before you switch, check if your fund charges a switching fee, or limits the number of times you can change options over a certain period.</p>",,5,0,3,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.95,541.0

However, choosing a suitable investment option for your circumstances can have a significant impact on your financial standing during retirement.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is cash superannuation investment?</strong></h3>\n<p>Some people choose to put their money in an investment cash account, which can be a good option if you want to protect the value of your investment over the short term. This is because a cash investment aims to guarantee your capital and accumulated earnings are not reduced by losses on investments.</p>\n<p>However, the flipside of investing super in cash is that growth is typically minimal, especially in the short term. As with most investments, lower risk usually means lower reward.</p>\n<p>With a cash investment, 100 per cent of your super money is deposited in deposit-taking institutions (such as banks) or in a 'capital-guaranteed' life insurance policy. Typically, a cash investment option is investment in a mix of term deposits, bank bills, and/or cash.</p>\n<p>A typical cash investment profile looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100 per cent in cash deposits</li>\n<li>Very low volatility</li>\n<li>No losses over a 20-year span</li>\n<li>Low growth</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Other types of superannuation investments</strong></h3>\n<p>Along with cash investment, there are three other main types of investment options:</p>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Growth</strong></span></p>\n<p>A growth investment option generally invests a majority of your money into higher-risk assets such as property and shares.</p>\n<p>Typical profile:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>80-100 per cent in shares and property</li>\n<li>The remainder in cash or fixed interest</li>\n<li>High volatility</li>\n<li>High growth</li>\n<li>4-5 years of losses over a 20-year span</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Balanced</strong></span></p>\n<p>A balanced investment option usually has more than half of a fund&rsquo;s assets in shares and the rest in property, fixed interest and cash.</p>\n<p>Typical profile:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>70 per cent in shares and property</li>\n<li>The remainder in cash or fixed interest</li>\n<li>Medium volatility</li>\n<li>Mid-high growth</li>\n<li>4 years of losses over a 20-year span</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Conservative</strong></span></p>\n<p>A conservative investment option is a low-risk investment option with a significant percentage of your money put into cash and fixed interest investments.</p>\n<p>Typical profile:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>30 per cent in shares and property</li>\n<li>The remainder in cash or fixed interest</li>\n<li>Low volatility</li>\n<li>Low-mid growth</li>\n<li>0 years of losses over a 20-year span</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>How to decide where to invest your super</strong></h3>\n<p>Factors such as your age, the amount of super you have and your level of financial knowledge should be factored in when deciding where to invest your super.</p>\n<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re younger you might be willing to invest in high-growth options while you can wait out the highs and lows of the market.

These investments can increase your wealth significantly, but there is risk. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Balanced investments &ndash;</span></strong><span> These investments try to offer the best of both worlds, giving their members the chance to unlock reasonable returns. You still have the potential to increase your wealth, but you&rsquo;re better hedged if the market is performing badly. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Conservative investments &ndash;</span></strong><span> These investments typically offer lower returns then their counterparts. The upside is there is a significantly reduced risk of loss, and the chances of having a &lsquo;bad year&rsquo; that will reduce your balance are generally much lower.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How do superannuation fixed interest investments fit in?</h3>\n<p><span>Superannuation funds that offer a conservative approach will often make fixed interest investments on behalf of their members. </span></p>\n<p><span>Fixed-interest investments generally occur when an investor lends money to governments, semi-government bodies and corporations, with an interest rate that is fixed and agreed upon for the term of the loan. </span></p>\n<p><span>This offers a level of investment certainty which can be attractive to many superannuation members looking to minimise their risk. </span></p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of superannuation fixed interest investments?</h3>\n<p><strong><span>Pros</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Lower risks over the short term &ndash;</span></strong><span> Superannuation funds with conservative approaches that offer fixed-interest investments can offer lower short-term risk, which many super account owners would find attractive, especially if the market is performing poorly. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Can be good for diversification &ndash;</span></strong><span> Fixed-interest investments also play a part in diversified portfolios. As these investments can perform quite differently from growth-driven ones, they can be useful to have up your sleeve as part of a balanced investment strategy. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span>Cons </span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Potential for a lower return over the long term &ndash;</span></strong><span> While there is less chance of copping a hit in your super balance as the result of a bad year in the short term, this other side of fixed-interest superannuation investments is that there will potentially be lower returns over the long term. Choosing a conservative investment strategy with fixed interest can be effective, but you could also miss the chance to significantly increase your superannuation balance.</span></li>\n</ul>",,5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.5,633.5

The way your money is invested depends on the investment option you&rsquo;ve chosen or had assigned as part of a default fund.</p>\n<p>A standard investment mix includes different asset categories, as well as single-sector options such as cash, property and shares. Certain super funds allow members to invest in international shares as part or all of their investment mix. People with self-managed super funds (SMSFs) can also choose to invest in overseas shares.</p>\n<h3>Benefits and risks of investing super in international shares</h3>\n<p>There are a number of potential benefits and risks to investing in the international share market.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wider choice &ndash;</strong> Investing in the global market opens you up to a wider pool of investment opportunities.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversification &ndash;</strong> International shares allow you to diversify your asset classes, meaning a slowdown in a single market may not have such a significant impact on your returns.</li>\n<li><strong>Currency exposure &ndash;</strong> Gaining exposure to foreign currencies can provide protection in the event of a downturn in the Australian dollar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Currency risk &ndash;</strong> Just as holding shares in a foreign currency can protect your super in certain circumstances, it can also expose you to higher volatility from fluctuations in the exchange rate.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher volatility &ndash;</strong> International investments may come with a higher level of risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How can I see where my super money is invested?</h3>\n<p>You can find out what your investment mix looks like by checking your superannuation member statement or logging into your super account online. Most investment strategies fall into one of the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Growth &ndash;</strong> A high-growth, high-risk option with a share of 80 per cent or more in shares and property, and the rest in cash or fixed interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Balanced &ndash;</strong> A mid-growth, mid- to high-risk option with around 70 per cent in shares and property, and the rest in cash or fixed interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Conservative &ndash;</strong> A low- to mid-growth, low-risk option with around 30 per cent in shares and property, and the rest in cash or fixed interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Cash &ndash;</strong> A low-growth, very low-risk option with 100 per cent in cash investments such as term deposits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usually, you can choose one of the approaches above, or a combination. If your fund allows investment in international shares, it would likely fall into a higher-risk approach.</p>\n<h3>Should you invest your super in international shares?</h3>\n<p>Your age, super balance, financial knowledge and comfort with risk should all factor in when deciding whether or not to choose a superannuation investment with international shares.</p>\n<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re under the age of 40 you might decide to invest in global shares because you can afford to take on more risk and ride out the highs and lows of the market.

However, you can make contributions to super as a tax-effective way of saving to buy property.</p>\n<h3>Saving for a house with the First Home Super Saver Scheme</h3>\n<p>In the 2017 federal budget, the government introduced the First Home Super Saver Scheme to help first home buyers enter the property market. The scheme is intended to increase the amount of money people can put towards a deposit thanks to the concessional tax rate and the higher rate of earnings through super.</p>\n<p>As of 1 July 2017, you can make voluntary contributions into a superannuation account to save for purchasing a first home. As of 1 July 2018, contributions and returns made can be withdrawn at a concessional tax rate to put toward a house deposit.</p>\n<p>Most people can salary sacrifice income to make pre-tax contributions to super as part of the First Home Super Saver Scheme. If you&rsquo;re self-employed or don&rsquo;t have the option to salary sacrifice, you can still make contributions and claim a tax deduction.</p>\n<p>These voluntary contributions are included in the total super contribution cap for each financial year.</p>\n<h3>Pros and cons of the First Home Super Saver Scheme</h3>\n<p>For many people, the First Home Super Saver Scheme is a tax-effective way to save for a first home. However, it&rsquo;s worth going over the positives and negatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tax advantages &ndash;</strong> Money put into super from pre-tax income or as a voluntary contribution is taxed at a discounted rate, as are earnings generated. Plus, investing in the scheme can reduce your taxable income, and therefore lower the tax you pay on your income.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher returns &ndash;</strong> Typically, you will earn more on your investment than you would by putting your money into a savings account.</li>\n<li><strong>Contributions are made individually &ndash;</strong> If you&rsquo;re part of a couple, you can both make contributions to the scheme within separate caps, then withdraw to put toward the one home deposit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Funds can only be used to buy a property &ndash;</strong> Once you make contributions to your super, funds can only be withdrawn for the purpose of buying a property. Otherwise, it&rsquo;ll be locked in your fund until your reach your preservation age.</li>\n<li><strong>Returns are fixed &ndash;</strong> The rate of return on contributions within the scheme is fixed. This means if your fund makes a bigger return, the additional money will stay in your account until you retire.</li>\n<li><strong>You may not have enough for a deposit &ndash;</strong> Depending on where you live in Australia, the money you&rsquo;ve saved through the scheme may still not be enough for a deposit on a home &ndash; meaning you could also have to dip into other savings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Can you invest in property through super?</h3>\n<p>If your super is part of a managed fund, some of your investment mix will typically include investments in property. In these cases, your fund&rsquo;s trustee is responsible for investing your money. So, while you may be able to choose what percentage of your money you want to go towards property, the investment decision-making ultimately lies with the trustee.</p>\n<p>If you have a self-managed super fund (SMSF), you can use your money to borrow and invest directly in property. However, the property has to be deemed as solely providing retirement benefits to fund members (i.e. you). That means it must be purchased as an investment rather than to live in.</p>\n<h3>Rules for buying property through an SMSF</h3>\n<p>To buy property through a self-managed super fund, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The property has to be bought for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits to you</li>\n<li>You can&rsquo;t buy the property from a relative or anyone associated with your SMSF</li>\n<li>The property can&rsquo;t be lived in by you or anyone associated with your SMSF</li>\n<li>The property can&rsquo;t be rented by you or anyone associated with your SMSF</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you can&rsquo;t buy a property to live in through an SMSF, it is possible to buy a property that you use for business purposes &ndash; allowing you to pay rent to your SMSF.</p>\n<h3>Borrowing money with an SMSF to buy property</h3>\n<p>Generally, your SMSF can&rsquo;t borrow money, but there are some exceptions, such as if you need cash to pay a member&rsquo;s benefit or settle a share transaction. You can also borrow (&ldquo;gear&rdquo;) your super into property by investing in managed funds that borrow money.</p>\n<p>Borrowing money to buy property using a self-managed super fund happens under strict borrowing conditions called a 'limited-recourse borrowing arrangement'. This arrangement can only be used to purchase a single asset, such as a residential or commercial property.</p>\n<p>There are a number of risks to gearing an SMSF, such as higher loan costs, tax losses and the potential for substantial losses to your super. If you&rsquo;re considering moving to an SMSF or borrowing through an SMSF, talk to a financial professional to make sure you understand the risks and obligations.</p>",,140,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,14.0,356.5

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Superannuation that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p>Typically, superannuation funds have three types of insurance&nbsp;for members:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Death cover (also known as life insurance) &ndash;</strong> This pays a benefit to your beneficiaries&nbsp;when you die</li>\n<li><strong>Total and permanent disability </strong><strong>(TPD) cover &ndash;</strong> This pays you a benefit if you become seriously disabled through illness or injury, and are unlikely to ever be able to work again</li>\n<li><strong>Income protection</strong><strong> (IP) cover &ndash;</strong> This pays you an income stream for a specified period if you are unable to work due to temporary illness or disability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your income protection policy will outline how your insurance covers you. This is usually for a specified percentage of your current regular income (usually 75 per cent of your gross salary) and for a set length of time.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to work because of illness or injury, you can make a claim and your income protection insurance will activate. There is normally a waiting period of 30 to 180 days before benefit payments begin, and payments are usually limited to a maximum of two years. After the waiting period, the policy will pay you the agreed amount either until you are able to return to work or for the specified period of time &ndash; whichever is sooner.</p>\n<h3>Who should get income protection insurance?</h3>\n<p>Income protection is particularly useful for households where one person provides the income. Obviously, if that person is temporarily out of action due to illness or disability, there will be financial strain as a result. This is especially so if you are paying off a mortgage or other significant loans.</p>\n<p>Because everyone&rsquo;s situation is different, it&rsquo;s worthwhile comparing different types and/or levels of income protection insurance, and to work out your own needs, should you be unable to work for a while. For example, someone with a family and a mortgage will need more cover than a single person living alone.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, that you can only insure your income from personal effort or employment. That means you can&rsquo;t insure income from investments (e.g. shares, long term deposits). The policy will also not pay out for redundancy or unemployment.</p>\n<p>Also, if you will have enough money to manage for a while without claiming on your insurance (for example you&rsquo;ll receive sick pay from your employer), then you may be able to save on your income insurance premiums by choosing a longer waiting period before payments begin.</p>\n<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>\n<p>The cost of income insurance will vary, depending on a number of factors, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your age</li>\n<li>Your job</li>\n<li>The percentage of your income that you&rsquo;d like to cover</li>\n<li>Your choice of waiting period length</li>\n<li>The illnesses and injuries you need covered</li>\n<li>Your current health, weight and family medical history</li>\n<li>Whether you smoke or have previously smoked</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of income protection insurance through my super?</h3>\n<p>As with any type of insurance through your super fund, there are factors worth considering. Let&rsquo;s look at a few:</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Usually cheaper &ndash;</strong> Super funds purchase insurance policies in bulk, so they can offer better deals on premiums. This means that, even when money is tight, you can still get cover</li>\n<li><strong>Easier to manage &ndash;</strong> Premiums are deducted automatically</li>\n<li><strong>May not need a health check &ndash;</strong> Depending on the fund and the amount of cover you&rsquo;re after</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limited cover &ndash;</strong> Not all types of insurance, or levels of cover,&nbsp;are offered</li>\n<li><strong>Not portable &ndash;</strong> If you move to another super fund or your employer's super contributions stop, your cover may stop without notice</li>\n<li><strong>Ends around retirement age &ndash;</strong> Insurance coverage through super often ends when you reach a certain age (usually 65 or 70), while external policies&nbsp;may&nbsp;cover you for longer.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduces your super balance &ndash;</strong> The cost of your insurance premiums are deducted from&nbsp;your super balance,&nbsp;reducing the&nbsp;money available&nbsp;for your retirement</li>\n<li><strong>Added complexity</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong> When you make a claim, you need to satisfy the trustee of the super fund as well as the fund&rsquo;s insurer in order to receive a payout. In other words, the benefit is not paid directly to you, but to your fund, which then decides whether to release it to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should compare the terms and conditions of the income protection policies on offer from your super fund with those available from outside insurers.</p>\n<p>If you decide to obtain income protection insure, make sure you review your policy from time to time, to ensure that your premiums are competitively priced and that the cover you have is still appropriate. For example, you may want to increase your cover if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&rsquo;re going to become a parent</li>\n<li>Your partner stops working</li>\n<li>You&rsquo;re taking out a new mortgage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, you might be in a position to decrease your level of cover if you start a new job and it comes with increased sick pay.</p>",,110,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,11.0,367.5

If you‰Ûªre considering taking out an insurance policy, it‰Ûªs worth first checking to see what (if any) insurance coverage is provided by your superannuation fund.</p>\n<h3>What types of super fund insurance are there?</h3>\n<p>Although coverage differs between funds, insurance offered by super funds typically falls into three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Death cover ‰ÛÒ</strong> Also known as ‰Û÷life insurance‰Ûª, this coverage allows your beneficiaries to access a benefit when you die, either as a lump sum or ongoing payments.</li>\n<li><strong>Income protection (IP) cover ‰ÛÒ</strong> If you can‰Ûªt work temporarily due to illness or disability, you‰Ûªll be paid an income for a defined period.</li>\n<li><strong>Total and permanent disability (TPD) cover ‰ÛÒ</strong> If you become disabled and will likely not be able to work again, you‰Ûªll be paid a benefit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind that the default super fund offered by your employer must offer a certain level of life insurance. You can find more information about your coverage by reading your fund‰Ûªs product disclosure statement.</p>\n<p>In most cases, you can also choose to alter or cancel your insurance cover if you‰Ûªd prefer to take out insurance elsewhere or not have to pay fees through your super.</p>\n<h3>Pros and cons of superannuation funds life insurance</h3>\n<p>There are a number of potential pros and cons to having life insurance through your super fund.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy to manage ‰ÛÒ</strong> Premiums are automatically deducted from your super balance rather than your bank account, which can make it easier to manage your cash flow.</li>\n<li><strong>Cheaper ‰ÛÒ</strong> Typically, life insurance through superannuation funds is cheaper because the funds can negotiate a group discount on policies and pass savings on to members.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible ‰ÛÒ</strong> You can usually choose your level of coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>No health checks required ‰ÛÒ</strong> Some super funds don‰Ûªt require a medical check to be eligible for insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limited cover ‰ÛÒ</strong> Depending on your fund, the available level of coverage may not be sufficient for your requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Beneficiaries aren‰Ûªt guaranteed ‰ÛÒ</strong> Some funds don‰Ûªt offer binding beneficiary nominations, meaning the fund‰Ûªs trustee decides who will get your money in case of your death.</li>\n<li><strong>Premiums come out of your super ‰ÛÒ</strong> Unless you choose to salary sacrifice the cost of your premium, it will come off the top of your super balance.</li>\n<li><strong>Slower payments ‰ÛÒ</strong> Because the insurance payout goes to the super fund before it goes to you, processing time for claims can be slower. This is especially the case for death benefits because the trustee has to reach a decision as to the correct beneficiary.</li>\n<li><strong>Ends at a certain age ‰ÛÒ</strong> Coverage usually ends when you reach age 65 or 70, whereas policies outside of super may cover you for longer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to find out if you have life insurance through your super</h3>\n<p>If your super is with the default fund offered by your employer, then you should have at least the minimum level of life insurance coverage for your age.</p>\n<p>However, it‰Ûªs worth checking the type of insurance cover you have, what you‰Ûªre covered for, and the cost of your premium. You can find these details by looking at your member statement or logging into your super account online.</p>\n<p>Also check how your insurance premiums are calculated to make sure they‰Ûªre appropriate. For example, if you‰Ûªre listed as a smoker even though you don‰Ûªt smoke, you may be paying more than you need to.</p>\n<h3>How to make an insurance claim through super</h3>\n<p>If you‰Ûªre the one making the insurance claim, you‰Ûªll likely need to fill out a claim form through your super fund. Claim forms are usually available on a super fund‰Ûªs website, or you can call and request one.</p>\n<p>When making a claim for income protection cover or total and permanent disability cover, you‰Ûªll need to provide documentation (such as medical certificates) to support your claim.</p>\n<p>In case of your death, your estate or beneficiaries will need to get in touch with your super fund to find out how to claim death benefits. The claim process usually requires documentation to determine the correct beneficiaries of your super money.</p>\n<h3>How to find superannuation funds with life insurance</h3>\n<p>Finding the right superannuation fund with life insurance takes some research. Although you may already have life insurance through your fund, it‰Ûªs important to make sure the coverage is appropriate for your needs. Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What type of insurance is offered ‰ÛÒ death cover, income protection cover, and/or total and permanent disability cover</li>\n<li>The level of coverage</li>\n<li>The cost of premiums</li>\n<li>How long you‰Ûªll be covered</li>\n<li>Whether you can nominate a binding beneficiary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you‰Ûªre thinking about switching funds, you can use RateCity‰Ûªs <span><a href=""https://www.ratecity.com.au/superannuation"">superannuation comparison tool</a></span> to see what insurance is offered by different super companies.</p>",,170,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,17.0,338.5

However, there are a number of other factors to consider aside from the fees to find a super fund that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>\n<h3>What types of fees do super funds charge?</h3>\n<p>Super funds charge a range of fees for different purposes, usually on a monthly basis or if you take an action (such as switching funds). The most common types of superannuation fees include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Admin fees &ndash;</strong> General fees to cover the cost of managing and operating your super fund membership.</li>\n<li><strong>Advice fees &ndash;</strong> Fees for financial advice given about your super and investments.</li>\n<li><strong>Investment fees &ndash;</strong> Fees for investment management, which can differ depending on the fund and investment strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>Switching & exit fees &ndash;</strong> Fees for changing your investment mix within the fund, or leaving the fund altogether.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction fees &ndash;</strong> Fees payable when you make a transaction such as contributing to the fund or withdrawing money.</li>\n<li><strong>Insurance premiums &ndash;</strong> The cost of insurance coverage such as death cover, income protection cover and/or total and permanent disability cover.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typically, these fees are deducted from your super balance any time you fulfil the criteria for being charged. In the case of admin fees, you&rsquo;re usually charged each month you&rsquo;re a member of the fund.</p>\n<h3>Do low-fee super funds equal better returns?</h3>\n<p>The short answer is that it depends. In some cases, choosing a fund with lower fees may be worthwhile because lower fees means more of your money can be reinvested and grow over time. For example, if your super balance is relatively low, you might choose a low-fee fund so that the fees don&rsquo;t cut into your modest balance too significantly.</p>\n<p>Over the long term, however, lower fees don&rsquo;t necessarily mean better returns for you. Your returns are based on a number of factors, including how you choose to invest your money, your particular super fund&rsquo;s performance and the performance of the market. So while high fees can eat into your overall balance and returns, they shouldn&rsquo;t be the only deciding factor when choosing a super fund.</p>\n<h3>Other factors to consider when choosing a super fund</h3>\n<p>Selecting an appropriate super fund isn&rsquo;t just about choosing the fund with the lowest fees. Here are some of the other key considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance &ndash;</strong> This refers to the returns a super fund has seen over a specified period, expressed as a percentage. Keep in mind that super is a long-term investment and returns fluctuate regularly &ndash; so it&rsquo;s best to look at a fund&rsquo;s overall returns over a longer-term period, minus fees and tax.</li>\n<li><strong>Investment options &ndash;</strong> Most super funds offer different investment options ranging from stable (such as cash investment) to highly volatile (such as 100 per cent investment in shares and property). Make sure that the fund you choose has a suitable investment option for your needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Extra benefits &ndash;</strong> Some employers pay more than the minimum contributions through certain funds. Consider whether you have access to an employer- or industry-specific fund where you can take advantage of these benefits.</li>\n<li><strong>Insurance &ndash;</strong> Most funds offer some level of life insurance cover for a fee. Check what coverage is available and the cost.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer service &ndash;</strong> Look for a fund that can offer support when you need it, and consider the fees charged for services like financial advice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to check your superannuation fees</h3>\n<p>Super funds are required to report the fees they charge in the fund&rsquo;s product disclosure statement and on your annual statement. You can also access information about your fund, including your fees, by logging into your super account online.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand what you&rsquo;re paying for when you pay super fees. If you&rsquo;re not sure why a certain fee is charged, get in touch with your super fund for more information.</p>\n<h3>Where to find the lowest-fee superannuation funds in Australia</h3>\n<p>You can find out how your current super fund&rsquo;s fees and costs shape up by doing a <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/superannuation"">super fund comparison.</a></span> Look at other fund&rsquo;s fee structures and costs to weigh up whether the fees you&rsquo;re paying are reasonable.</p>\n<p>Remember that low fees aren&rsquo;t the only yardstick for determining the best fund. It&rsquo;s worth also considering long-term performance, investment options, benefits and insurance to get a clearer picture of whether a super fund is right for your circumstances.</p>",,140,12,167,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,45.05,272.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Superannuation that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p>Living comfortably during retirement is a goal most of us share, and your superannuation provides a financial safety net for that very reason.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth getting to know how superannuation and funds work so that you know how your money is being invested and can plan for the future.</p>\n<h3>How does superannuation work?</h3>\n<p>Superannuation is a tax-effective, long-term savings plan designed to provide you with income when you retire. Most people working in Melbourne and around the country are entitled to earn superannuation on top of their usual income.</p>\n<p>During your working life, your employer makes contributions to your super, and you can make voluntary contributions of your own. If you&rsquo;re a low-income earner, the government may also make contributions for you.</p>\n<p>Your superannuation is put into a fund of your choosing, where it is invested by the fund&rsquo;s trustee into assets such as shares, property and cash. Most funds offer a variety of investment options for members.</p>\n<p>Typically, you can only access your super when you hit your &lsquo;preservation age&rsquo;, which differs depending on the year you were born and usually coincides with your retirement age. You can then choose to access your money as a lump sum, income stream or a combination.</p>\n<h3>What are your super investment options in Melbourne?</h3>\n<p>Superannuation in Melbourne operates the same as anywhere else in Australia. The investment options available to you depend on the fund you&rsquo;re with, or if you have a self-managed super fund (SMSF).</p>\n<p>Most managed funds offer investment options in the following categories:</p>\n<p><strong>Cash</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>100 per cent invested in cash or fixed interest assets</li>\n<li>Very low risk</li>\n<li>Low returns</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conservative</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 30 per cent invested in shares and property, and the remainder in cash or fixed interest assets</li>\n<li>Low risk</li>\n<li>Low-to-medium returns</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Balanced</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 70 per cent invested in shares and property, and the remainder in cash or fixed interest assets</li>\n<li>Medium risk</li>\n<li>Medium returns</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Growth</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>More than 80 per cent invested in shares and property, and the remainder in cash or fixed interest assets</li>\n<li>High risk</li>\n<li>Medium-to-high returns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When deciding on an investment approach, think about how much risk you&rsquo;re willing to take on and whether you&rsquo;re comfortable with potentially experiencing negative returns in some years. Higher-risk options tend to fluctuate more significantly, but may yield higher returns over the long term.</p>\n<h3>How to compare super funds</h3>\n<p>Some industrial awards in Melbourne and elsewhere specify a fund or a choice of limited funds that your super has to be paid into. For most people, however, you can nominate a super fund of your choosing.</p>\n<p>When choosing a fund, consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fees &ndash;</strong> How much you have to pay and what fees are charged for.</li>\n<li><strong>Returns &ndash;</strong> The average percentage of returns for each of a fund&rsquo;s investment options. Returns change regularly, so it&rsquo;s best to look at results over at least five years.</li>\n<li><strong>Investment options &ndash;</strong> Whether a fund&rsquo;s asset classes and investment mixes are appropriate for you.</li>\n<li><strong>Other benefits &ndash;</strong> What insurances and other member benefits are available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking to join a super fund in Melbourne or anywhere else in Australia, you can find information by looking at fund websites, product disclosure statements, and by using RateCity&rsquo;s <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/superannuation"">super comparison tool.</a></p>",,40,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,4.0,433.5

As a general rule, these are national funds, rather than Perth-based funds, but they serve people in Perth just as they would workers in the rest of Australia.</p>\n<p>The purpose of superannuation is to provide you with money in your retirement. All things being equal, more money is better than less, which is why most people aim to choose a fund that will provide them with the highest rate of return.</p>\n<p>There are more than 200 superannuation funds serving the residents of Perth, so identifying the best fund is easier said than done. One place to do your research is with a superannuation comparison search engine, like the one at the top of this page.</p>\n<h3>How to compare funds</h3>\n<p>One way that some people compare funds is by trying to calculate which will provide them with the highest rate of return. To do that, you need to look at two things &ndash; the fund&rsquo;s investment performance and its fee structure.</p>\n<p>As an example, let&rsquo;s do a hypothetical (and highly simplified) comparison between Fund A and Fund B. Fund A produces annual growth of 8 per cent and charges fees of 1 per cent, for a return of 7 per cent. Fund B produces annual growth of 8.3 per cent and charges fees of 1.5 per cent, for a return of 6.8 per cent. So even though Fund A has lower growth than Fund B, it actually delivers a higher return.</p>\n<p>Another way people compare funds is by looking at how they spread their investments. Typically, funds will invest in Australian equities, international equities, property, fixed interest and cash &ndash; but in what proportions? For example, one fund might devote 35 per cent of its money to Australian equities and 30 per cent to international equities; another might devote 30 per cent locally and 40 per cent overseas.</p>\n<p>Some people also like to evaluate funds by looking at how long they&rsquo;ve been around, how many members they have and how much in assets they manage.</p>\n<h3>How to increase your superannuation</h3>\n<p>Whatever fund you choose, you&rsquo;ll probably want to retire with more money in your superannuation account than less. One way to do that is to &lsquo;salary sacrifice&rsquo;, which involves asking your employer to pay part of your pre-tax salary straight into your superannuation account. Like regular superannuation contributions, salary sacrifices are taxed at 15 per cent when they are paid into the fund.</p>\n<p>At the moment, your employer must pay you superannuation equivalent to 9.5 per cent of your salary &ndash; although this is scheduled to rise to 10.0 per cent in 2021-22, 10.5 per cent in 2022-23, 11.0 per cent in 2023-24, 11.5 per cent in 2024-25 and 12.0 per cent in 2025-26. A salary sacrifice will allow you to increase this rate. Please note, though, that the amount of &lsquo;concessional contributions&rsquo; (or contributions taxed at the special superannuation rate) that you and your employer can make per year is a combined $25,000. You can also make additional non-concessional contributions, but these won&rsquo;t have the same tax benefits.</p>",,5,0,3,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,0.95,541.0

This is more than what the rate has been in the past: before the super guarantee was introduced in 1992, employers only paid 3 per cent of earnings into your super fund.</p>\n<p>To further increase your savings, superannuation is also designed to be a tax-effective structure. Your employer&rsquo;s super contribution is taxed at a concessional rate that is much lower than the tax you pay on your income. Extra money you put into your super fund can also attract tax benefits, depending on type of contributions they are.</p>\n<p>To stay on top of your super, here are some ways to keep track of your savings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check how much superannuation you currently have set aside by visiting the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) section of your online myGov account.

There is no official retirement age in Australia, but you can only withdraw your super when you reach your <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/paying-benefits/preservation-of-super/"">preservation age</a></span> (currently between 55 and 60, depending on when you were born) and are retired.</li>\n<li><strong>How much of the age pension you will receive &ndash;</strong> many retirees use their super to supplement their age pension income. You can find out more about age pension eligibility and payment rates on the <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/age-pension#group-125"">Department of Human Services website</a></span>.</li>\n<li><strong>The standard of living you want to maintain &ndash;</strong> how much super you&rsquo;ll need will depend on how much money you plan to spend in retirement on discretionary expenses like holidays, eating out and entertainment.</li>\n<li><strong>Your living situation &ndash;</strong> whether you are renting, paying off a mortgage, own your home outright or are living rent-free with family will affect how much super you need.</li>\n<li>If you have any outstanding debts at retirement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To give you an idea of how much you may need to retire, the <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.superannuation.asn.au/"">Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia</a></span> estimated how much retirees typically need if they want to live a &lsquo;modest&rsquo; or &lsquo;comfortable&rsquo; lifestyle.</p>\n<p>According to ASFA&rsquo;s figures from the June quarter of 2017, a couple living a modest lifestyle will need $34,911 a year to live on, while a couple with a comfortable living standard will need $60,063 per year. For singles, the amount is $24,270 and $43,695 respectively.</p>\n<h3>How can I increase my superannuation?</h3>\n<p>Making voluntary contributions towards your superannuation &ndash; on top of your employer&rsquo;s compulsory contributions &ndash; can help give your retirement nest egg a boost while you are still earning money.</p>\n<p>Here are four ways to increase your superannuation before you retire.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Make concessional contributions: put money in your fund by salary sacrificing</strong></p>\n<p>One way to boost your savings is to &lsquo;salary sacrifice&rsquo; by arranging for your employer to direct some of your before-tax salary into your superannuation fund.</p>\n<p>The advantage of salary sacrificing is any money you put into your super fund attracts a lower tax rate compared to the marginal tax rate. There is a cap, though, on the amount of money you can contribute before tax. If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay a penalty tax on your contribution.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Make non-concessional contributions: put money in your super from your after-tax income</strong></p>\n<p>You can also increase your super by putting money into your super fund from your after-tax income. Like before-tax contributions, this amount is also capped per financial year. If you are under the age of 65, though, you can &lsquo;bring forward&rsquo; the next two years&rsquo; worth of after-tax contributions and increase the amount you contribute in a financial year.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Check if you are eligible for a government co-contribution</strong></p>\n<p>To help people with lower incomes save for their retirement, the government established a co-contribution scheme called the Low Income Superannuation Tax Offset (LISTO).</p>\n<p>LISTO refunds some of the tax paid on concessional super contributions. To be eligible for the benefit, you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have an adjusted taxable income of no more than $37,000 for the financial year</li>\n<li>derive at least 10 per cent of your total income from employment or your business</li>\n<li>make concessional (that is, before-tax) contributions to your super</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Receive contributions from your spouse or partner</strong></p>\n<p>Your spouse or de facto partner can help top up your super by making contributions into your fund. As an added benefit, if you earn no income or a low amount of income, your partner can claim a tax offset for the contributions they make.</p>\n<p>Another way to boost your super is to arrange for &lsquo;contribution splitting&rsquo; with your partner, where some of their super contributions is placed into your super account. Contribution splitting is allowed so long as you are under the preservation age, or between your preservation age and 65 years and not retired.</p>\n<p>To help you make an informed choice about super contributions, ASIC&rsquo;s <span><a href=""https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-apps/super-contributions-optimiser"">calculator</a></span> estimates what type of contribution will give you the biggest boost towards retirement.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is a SMSF?</strong></h3>\n<p>A self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) is your own personal super fund, regulated by the ATO, which offers you hands-on control over how your money is invested.</p>\n<p>Members of an SMSF are trustees, responsible for developing the fund&rsquo;s investment strategy, keeping detailed records and organising an independent audit for the fund. Trustees are liable if the fund doesn&rsquo;t meet the government&rsquo;s statutory and regulatory super requirements.</p>\n<h3><strong>Can I accumulate more money in an SMSF?</strong></h3>\n<p>There is no one answer as to whether you can accrue more money in an SMSF compared to a retail or industry super fund.</p>\n<p>The general wisdom is the more super you have, the more cost-effective an SMSF is to run. ASIC recommends ensuring you have enough start-up money to make an SMSF a viable option, as SMSFs can come with more fees for accounting, legal work, audits and tax advice.</p>\n<p>If you would like more advice, you can hire the services of a financial planner or accountant to help you. The ATO also has educational <span><a href=""https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/In-detail/SMSF-resources/SMSF-videos/"">videos</a></span> on their website about setting up an SMSF in Australia.</p>",,5,0,3,0,49,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,5.8500000000000005,405.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Superannuation that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p>Retail superannuation funds are just one of the many Australian superannuation funds on offer to Australian workers. They are run for profit and offer a wide range of investments.</p>\n<p>Anyone can join a retail super fund, and just like all other super funds there are pros and cons. Retail super funds are the largest sector in the Australian superannuation market.</p>\n<h3>What is a retail super fund?</h3>\n<p>Retail superannuation funds are run by banks and other financial&nbsp;institutions. These superannuation funds, which are run by the likes&nbsp;of the Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac, Suncorp, ING&nbsp;and other Australian banks, are run to generate a profit&nbsp;for their shareholders.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of investment options in a retail super fund with&nbsp;most funds offering hundreds of choices. The investments range&nbsp;from Australian shares, property, cash, international shares or could&nbsp;even be made up of a mixture of all these.</p>\n<p>Originally retail super funds were developed by banks, investment institutions and insurance companies to cater for savvy people keen to save for their retirement.</p>\n<h3>Who offers retail super funds?</h3>\n<p>There are many Australia banks, big investment firms and&nbsp;insurance companies who operate retail super funds. The big&nbsp;four banks (Commonwealth Bank, NAB, ANZ and&nbsp;Westpac) all have retail superannuation funds on offer.</p>\n<p>Other Australian banks offering retail super funds include ING, Bendigo Bank, Suncorp and AMP. Some prominent&nbsp;financial companies offer retail super funds as well. Investment&nbsp;companies like Virgin Money, MLC and Perpetual have their own&nbsp;retail super funds as well.</p>\n<h3>Can anyone join a retail super fund?</h3>\n<p>Yes, retail super funds are open to anyone, but they are not&nbsp;always suitable for everyone. Always do your research before&nbsp;committing to a super fund.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, retail funds were set up for white-collar workers&nbsp;who often worked for the institutions their superannuation was&nbsp;invested in, but today anyone is welcome to join retail super&nbsp;funds.</p>\n<h3>How does a retail superannuation fund work?</h3>\n<p>Just like other superannuation funds, members of a retail&nbsp;superannuation fund will have their money invested into&nbsp;different shares, stocks and investments. This is done by&nbsp;professional investment managers.</p>\n<p>The money in your retail super fund comes from contributions made by your employer as well as any extras you put into it. This money is kept away and is accessed when you retire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Retail super funds are usually accumulation funds, which aim to grow funds that are held in the accounts over time. Due to the investments it is important to note that with an accumulation fund&nbsp;you&nbsp;run the risk that when you retire, your super payout can be lower if financial markets have recently fallen or continue to fall during your retirement.</p>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of retail super funds?</h3>\n<p>Just like all Australian superannuation funds, there are pros&nbsp;and cons. If you are considering signing up to a retail super&nbsp;fund you should consider all angles and what super fund is&nbsp;best for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anyone can join a retail superannuation fund.</li>\n<li>They usually offer a large number of investment options and choices.</li>\n<li>Wide range of costs for different funds means they are accessible for different levels of income and super contributions.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Retail super funds are usually accumulation funds.</li>\n<li>They can offer members a range of insurances on their superannuation funds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retail super funds are run to generate corporate profits, which are passed on as dividends to the company&rsquo;s shareholders, not as profits to super fund members.</li>\n<li>Accumulation funds can be impacted by global financial market turbulence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should always consider your personal retirement and lifestyle&nbsp;choices before committing to any specific superannuation fund.</p>\n<h3>What other types of super fund are out there?</h3>\n<p>A retail superannuation fund is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of Australian super funds on offer. There are other types of funds, all with different pros and cons associated with them, each aimed at fitting different lifestyles and financial situations.</p>\n<p>Self-managed super funds put you in the driving seat of your own superannuation. A self-managed super fund makes you the manager of your super finances instead of a professional investor or fund manager, giving you more control over your superannuation investments. Unlike other superannuation funds, a self-managed fund requires a lot of time and commitment, and there are risks involved in managing your own superannuation.</p>\n<p>Industry superannuation funds are the main competition for retail superannuation funds. They are sometimes restricted to workers of a particular industry and tend to be run not-for-profit, meaning they give their profits back to their members. Industry super funds tend not to be operated by the Australian big four banks (Commonwealth Bank, NAB, ANZ Bank and Westpac) because they are run not-for-profit.</p>\n<p>Public sector superannuation funds are almost exclusive to employees of the federal and state government. They were created to cater to employees of many different government departments, who are often paid more than the normal contribution rate. Public sector super funds tend to have low fees and offer a medium range of investment options.</p>\n<h3>What should you look for when choosing a fund?</h3>\n<p>The number one thing you need to consider when choosing a&nbsp;retail super fund, or any other fund out on the market, is your&nbsp;own personal goals, lifestyle and financial situation.</p>\n<p>It is always important to consider all super funds on the market so&nbsp;you can get the best possible deal and the most possible growth in&nbsp;your superannuation fund.</p>\n<p>We all want to be able to retire comfortably, so setting up the right&nbsp;Australian super fund for you is important.</p>\n<p>There are some questions you should ask yourself when choosing&nbsp;your Australian superannuation fund:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are my long-term and short-term life goals?</li>\n<li>Do I own property?</li>\n<li>How much will I need when I retire?</li>\n<li>What do I want to do in my retirement?</li>\n<li>At what age do I want to retire?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are some but not all of the things you need to consider when&nbsp;looking for the right super fund.</p>\n<p>Always chat to your employer about your options, because depending on your employment situation you may or may not be able to choose your own individual superannuation fund.</p>\n<h3>How can I access my super?</h3>\n<p>When you retire, you&rsquo;ll need to assess a few things about your&nbsp;superannuation. You need to decide if you want your super as&nbsp;a regular pension, a big lump sum or a combination of both of&nbsp;these options.</p>\n<p>You access your super after you&rsquo;ve retired. Each super fund&nbsp;offers different levels of access to your superannuation so it is&nbsp;best to always understand the ins and outs of each fund&nbsp;depending on your own retirement goals.</p>\n<h3>How much superannuation will I get?</h3>\n<p>Your final superannuation payout will depend on a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much your employer contributed across your life.</li>\n<li>How much you personally contributed into your personal super fund.</li>\n<li>The investment returns in your super fund.</li>\n<li>The amount of fees and charges you paid on your account.</li>\n<li>The amount of tax you paid across your lifetime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are always variables to all of these depending on your choice&nbsp;of superannuation fund.</p>",,40,0,14,0,6,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,6.7,399.0

Though only a small percentage of your income is contributed to your super fund every pay cycle, this adds up over time to create a nest egg by the time you reach retirement.</p>\n<p>How much superannuation you need to retire depends on the kind of retirement lifestyle you have in mind, but what is clear is that the more you have in your superannuation fund, the more financially comfortable your retirement should be.</p>\n<p>This is why some Australians choose to make voluntary super contributions on top of the minimum of 9.5 per cent of total income contributed to their superannuation fund by their employer.</p>\n<h3>The basics of self-managed superannuation funds</h3>\n<p>Self-managed super funds are similar to super funds managed by financial institutions and professional investment managers in that they are funds where you keep, and from which you can invest, your savings.</p>\n<p>The main difference, however, is that self-managed super funds are not managed by professional investment managers &ndash; instead, they are private superannuation funds which are regulated by the ATO and managed independently by you.</p>\n<p>If you opt to set up a self-managed super fund, you are responsible for all decisions relating to the fund, and are expected to be compliant with the laws governing super funds. Self-managed super funds allow for up to four members who must all be trustees, and the fund&rsquo;s sole purpose must be to providing for the retirement of members.</p>\n<p>Here, in the words of ASIC, the financial services regulator, is what you must do if you run a self-managed super fund:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carry out the role of trustee or director, which imposes important legal obligations on you</li>\n<li>Set and follow an investment strategy that is appropriate for your risk tolerance and is&nbsp;likely to meet your retirement needs</li>\n<li>Have the financial experience and skills to make sound investment decisions</li>\n<li>Have enough time to research investments and manage the fund</li>\n<li>Budget for ongoing expenses such as professional accounting, tax, audit, legal and financial advice</li>\n<li>Keep comprehensive records and arrange an annual audit by an approved SMSF auditor</li>\n<li>Organise insurance, including&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/insurance/life-insurance/income-protection"">income protection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/insurance/life-insurance/total-and-permanent-disability-cover"">total and permanent disability</a>&nbsp;cover for super fund members</li>\n<li>Use the money only to provide retirement benefits</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Should I start a self-managed super fund?</h3>\n<p>It is recommended you conduct thorough research, evaluate your financial position and seek professional advice before committing to starting a self-managed super fund.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a self-managed super fund is likely to require a lot of time and specific financial knowledge and skills, so it might be beneficial to speak to professionals before setting up a self-managed super fund.</p>\n<p>They might be able to help you consider the pros and cons of running a self-managed super fund, guide you through the administration requirements and assist with investment decisions as well.</p>\n<h3>The right professionals</h3>\n<p>As with most financial decisions, working with the right professionals could be beneficial to you and all trustees. Professionals you approach could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An accountant, for assistance with the fund&rsquo;s accounts and operating statements</li>\n<li>A tax agent, for assistance with logging returns and tax advice</li>\n<li>A fund administrator, for assistance with the running of your fund</li>\n<li>A legal practitioner, for legal advice and assistance with your fund&rsquo;s trust deed.</li>\n<li>A financial adviser, for assistance with preparing and executing investment strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that even if you choose to approach the above professionals for help, you will still be responsible for ensuring all tasks are completed correctly and adhere to legislation surrounding self-managed super funds.</p>\n<h3>Setting up a self-managed super fund</h3>\n<p>According to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), there a several steps that must be taken when setting up a self-managed super fund. Appointing professionals for assistance are among the most crucial. Once this has been done, the following steps should be taken:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choosing individual trustees or a corporate trustee</strong>: Self-managed super funds can have up to four individual trustees, or a company acting as a trustee. Costs, requirements and ownership of assets will differ for each of the above options.</li>\n<li><strong>Creating the trust and trust deed: </strong>The trust deed is the legally binding document which details the arrangements relating to the trust and its beneficiaries, and how the fund is operated. It is a legal document, so it must be prepared by someone who is qualified to do so, and must be agreed upon and signed by all trustees.</li>\n<li><strong>Appointing your trustees: </strong>All trustees must submit their consent in writing, and sign a trustee declaration which provides confirmation of understanding of all associated duties and responsibilities. Eligibility criteria applies to anyone hoping to be a trustee.</li>\n<li><strong>Checking your fund is an Australian super fund: </strong>It must be so for the entire financial year to be a complying super fund. If this is not the case, associated assents and income will be taxed at the highest marginal tax rate.</li>\n<li><strong>Registering your fund: </strong>Your self-managed super fund must be registered with the ATO. During the registration process, you can apply for a TFN, ABN and register for GST if you feel necessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Setting up a bank account for your fund: </strong>This is necessary to pay the fund&rsquo;s expenses and liabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Investments</h3>\n<p>Though it could be tempting to start making investments right away, preparing an investment strategy for your self-managed super fund could be beneficial to you and all trustees in the long run.</p>\n<p>This strategy should be reviewed regularly and amended to suit changes in income, personal circumstances, diversification plans, the liquidity of the fund&rsquo;s assets and the find&rsquo;s ability to pay benefits when members reach retirement.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the sole purpose test must be met for self-managed super funds to be eligible for the tax concessions generally available to super funds. That is, the fund must be maintained for the sole purpose of being used during the retirement of the member or members, and investments made should reflect this purpose.</p>\n<p>The ATO does specify some restrictions to investments, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The purchase and sale price of assets must reflect market value</li>\n<li>The fund cannot borrow money (except in certain limited circumstances)</li>\n<li>Assets cannot be bought from, and money cannot be loaned to, fund members (except in certain limited circumstances)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to close a self-managed super fund</h3>\n<p>Requirements specified in the trust deed will have to be met and benefits must be dealt with before closing a self-managed super fund.</p>\n<p>Once this is done, appointing an SMSF auditor is recommended, to complete the final audit for the fund.</p>\n<p>Then, the final annual return should be lodged, and outstanding tax and expected liabilities settled before closing the fund&rsquo;s bank account and winding up the self-managed super fund.</p>\n<h3>Pros and cons</h3>\n<p>Setting up a self-managed super fund will give your more control over your investments and how you buy and sell assets, giving you the chance to try to outperform traditional superannuation funds.</p>\n<p>That being said, they generally involve high set-up costs and annual running expenses, so a large superannuation balance would be necessary for the fund to be cost-effective. Also, they require a level of financial expertise that a lot of people don&rsquo;t have.</p>\n<h3>Alternatives</h3>\n<p>If you feel a self-managed super fund isn&rsquo;t the best option for you, consider opting for an industry super fund or one managed by a financial institution or private company.</p>",,1000,0,3,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,100.45,215.0

View all product details, interest rates and fees to find the Superannuation that suits your needs at RateCity",,,,,,"<p>Self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) are a popular type of superannuation in Australia. But what exactly is an SMSF, and how does it work? Here is a quick guide to get you started.</p>\n<h3>What is an SMSF?</h3>\n<p>An SMSF is your own personal super fund that gives you complete control over how your money is invested. Self-managed super funds have similar benefits to professionally managed funds, such as concessional tax rates and the ability to accept contributions from your employer.</p>\n<p>SMSFs, though, have the following unique features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each member is a trustee, with up to four individual trustees allowed in a fund</li>\n<li>SMSFs are regulated by the Australian Tax Office (ATO)</li>\n<li>They must pass the &lsquo;sole purpose test&rsquo;, which proves the fund exists only to provide benefits to its members on their retirement (or to beneficiaries in the event of death)</li>\n<li>While an SMSF has no minimum balance, the general wisdom is the higher the fund balance, the more cost-effective the SMSF is compared to other superannuation funds in Australia</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What do SMSF trustees do?</h3>\n<p>Trustees oversee their SMSF&rsquo;s investment strategy. They are also responsible and personally liable for the legal and statutory requirements of their fund.</p>\n<p>Trustee responsibilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing, implementing and reviewing the SMSF&rsquo;s investment strategy (this is compulsory)</li>\n<li>Maintaining records such as financial statements and a transfer balance account report</li>\n<li>Organising an independent audit of the SMSF and lodging an annual tax return</li>\n<li>Purchasing insurance, including income protection and disability cover</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All this paperwork can be complex, and accuracy is needed to make sure your SMSF meets government regulations. Well-considered SMSF strategies for investment are also important for future financial security.</p>\n<p>If you need help, the ATO&rsquo;s <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/administering-and-reporting/"">videos and guides</a></span> can provide assistance. You can also hire an adviser to help administer your SMSF and develop an investment strategy, although you are still liable for any decisions made.</p>\n<h3>Can I get SMSF loans to buy property?</h3>\n<p>Using an SMSF to invest in property is one way to build retirement wealth. In recent times, this has become a more popular option due to a &lsquo;limited recourse borrowing arrangement&rsquo; (LRBA): a special type of loan which allows SMSF trustees to borrow money for property purchases.</p>\n<p>If you default on your loan, an LRBA restricts the compensation a lender can seek, which means you are not at risk of losing your entire super. Take note, though: when it comes to SMSF borrowing, you can&rsquo;t use a LRBA to buy property to live in. The purchase must be for the sole purpose of investing in your retirement.</p>\n<h3>How do you set up an SMSF?</h3>\n<p>An accountant or adviser can help you establish an SMSF, but the basic steps are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obtain a trust deed: a legal document that sets out the rules for operating your SMSF</li>\n<li>Appoint trustees and sign the trustee declaration</li>\n<li>Lodge an election to be a regulated, self-managed fund with the ATO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once your&nbsp;<span><a href=""http://www.superannuationwarehouse.com.au/"">SMSF</a></span>&nbsp;is set up, you can roll your superannuation balance from your former fund into your SMSF through a special <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Rollover-initiation-request-to-transfer-whole-balance-of-superannuation-benefits-to-your-self-managed-super-fund/"">ATO request form</a></span>.</p>",,40,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,4.0,433.5

Below are four basic things you need to know about how superannuation in Australia works.</p>\n<h3>Superannuation is a tax-effective way of saving for your retirement</h3>\n<p>Super is essentially money put in a fund by your employer throughout your working life, so you have an income to live on when you retire. You can access your super when you reach your &lsquo;preservation age&rsquo;, which ranges from 55 to 60 depending on the year of your birth.</p>\n<p>Currently, employers must contribute the equivalent of 9.5 per cent of their employee&rsquo;s ordinary time earnings to their super, thanks to a system called the superannuation guarantee. (The guarantee is scheduled to incrementally rise to 12.0 per cent by 2025-26.)</p>\n<p>The contribution is only taxed at 15 per cent, which is less than half the average marginal tax rate for most workers. This means superannuation is tax-effective way to save for your retirement.</p>\n<h3>You can choose your own super fund</h3>\n<p>Unless you select your own fund, your employer will choose one for you. It&rsquo;s worth knowing what options are available, as your fund&rsquo;s performance impacts how much super you have at retirement.</p>\n<p>There are different types of superannuation funds in Australia, ranging from not-for-profit industry super funds to retail funds run by banks. Things to consider when doing your research include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>What insurance cover is offered &ndash; </span></strong><span>you can get life insurance, disability cover and income protection cover with many funds. It&rsquo;s worth checking the premiums charged, and what limitations and health checks are in place.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>How the fund performs </span></strong><span>&ndash; funds offer different investment strategies with a mix of high and low-growth options. You can compare five-year investment performance of different super funds through <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ratecity.com.au/superannuation/search"">RateCity</a>.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Fees charged </span></strong><span>&ndash; these may include fees for administration, switching investments, advice or exiting.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>You can make extra contributions to your super</h3>\n<p>The maths is simple: the more you save, the more super you accrue for your retirement.<br /> One way to boost your super is to &lsquo;salary sacrifice&rsquo;, by asking your employer to send some of your before-tax salary to your super fund. The advantage of salary sacrificing is any money contributed to super attracts a much lower tax rate of 15 per cent. But take care: the amount of before-tax contributions you can make is capped at $25,000 a year.</p>\n<p>Another way to increase your super is to make contributions from your after-tax income.</p>\n<p>You can currently contribute up to $100,000 per financial year.</p>\n<h3>Finding lost super is easier than you think</h3>\n<p>If, for example, you&rsquo;ve moved from Melbourne to Sydney to change jobs and you&rsquo;re not sure where your super is held, or you have lots of multiple accounts, don&rsquo;t worry: you can find your lost super by using the online MyGov service. Visit the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/Keeping-track-of-your-super/"">ATO website</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>Rolling your super into one fund is worth considering, as it cuts down on fees and makes it easier to keep track of your savings. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ratecity.com.au/superannuation"">RateCity can help</a> you compare super funds and find one that best suits your needs.</p>",,40,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,4.0,433.5

With TPD insurance, you&rsquo;re paid a lump sum to help cover the cost of living, medical treatment, rehabilitation and debt repayments.</p>\n<p>Certain superannuation funds offer total and permanent disability cover as part of broader life insurance coverage. With TPD cover through your super, you pay a premium just as you would any other insurance policy, but the cost is taken out of your super balance.</p>\n<h3>How to find out if you have total and permanent disability cover through your super</h3>\n<p>Many super funds offer life insurance coverage, but not all include total and disability permanent cover. If your super is with your employer&rsquo;s default fund, the fund is required to offer a minimum level of life insurance, but that usually doesn&rsquo;t include TPD cover.</p>\n<p>To check insurance coverage through your super, take a look at your member statement or login to your super account online. Make sure to check the type of insurance cover you have (because it may not include total and disability cover), what you&rsquo;re covered for, and the cost of your premium.</p>\n<h3>What other types of insurance are offered by super funds?</h3>\n<p>Along with TPD insurance, many superannuation funds offer the following types of insurance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Death cover &ndash;</strong> This is generally called &lsquo;life insurance&rsquo; and gives your beneficiaries a benefit if you die, either as a lump sum or ongoing payments.</li>\n<li><strong>Income protection (IP) cover &ndash;</strong> If you&rsquo;re out of work temporarily due to illness or disability, you can be paid an income for a specified period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Super funds that offer a basic level of life insurance (death cover) will usually allow you to tailor your coverage to suit your needs. So even if you don&rsquo;t have TPD cover as part of your current insurance, you may be able to add it on.</p>\n<h3>Should you get total and permanent disability cover?</h3>\n<p>While income protection insurance can replace some of your income if you are temporarily unable to work due to illness or injury, it could also useful to have a lump sum of money to cover your immediate costs. That&rsquo;s where TPD cover comes in.</p>\n<p>Deciding whether to get total and permanent disability cover depends on a number of factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Occupation &ndash;</strong> Whether your work makes you susceptible to permanent injury or illness.</li>\n<li><strong>Current insurance &ndash;</strong> Whether other insurance offered by your super or a private health fund is sufficient.</li>\n<li><strong>Family income &ndash;</strong> What you earn as a family and whether it would be enough to live off if you had to stop working permanently.</li>\n<li><strong>Support network &ndash;</strong> How much support and assistance would be available to you if you had to stop working.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility &ndash;</strong> Whether you could afford to cut down on expenses or reduce debt.</li>\n<li><strong>Other benefits available to you &ndash;</strong> Whether you could access benefits through workers&rsquo; compensation or the government.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to make a TPD claim</h3>\n<p>You can make a TPD claim if you satisfy the criteria for total and permanent disability outlined by your super fund or insurance provider.</p>\n<p>To make a claim, you&rsquo;ll need to get in touch with your provider so they can give you the necessary claim forms. You&rsquo;ll also need to provide supporting documentation (such as medical reports) to prove that you&rsquo;re no longer able to work.</p>\n<h3>How to find superannuation funds with total and permanent disability cover</h3>\n<p>Your occupation, age and other factors will likely dictate whether or not you decide to take out total and permanent disability cover. If you decide to purchase TPD insurance, doing so through your super fund could be the most cost-effective option. This is because super funds are able to purchase policies in bulk and pass on savings to members.</p>\n<p>When comparing superannuation funds with total and permanent disability cover, be sure to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The level of coverage &ndash;</strong> Calculate whether the lump sum payout would be adequate to live off if you had to stop working.</li>\n<li><strong>The definition of TPD &ndash;</strong> Different providers have different criteria for total and permanent disability. Read the product disclosure statement to see the definition.</li>\n<li><strong>Own or any occupation &ndash;</strong> Some policies allow you to claim if you can no longer work in your usual occupation, whereas others will only allow you to claim if you can no longer work in any capacity.</li>\n<li><strong>Whether you can link policies &ndash;</strong> Bundling a life insurance policy with TPD is often most cost-effective.</li>\n<li><strong>A buy-back option &ndash;</strong> You may be able to purchase a buy-back option, which allows you to reinstate the amount deducted from your benefit when you make a claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Waiting period &ndash;</strong> You may have to wait for a specified period after applying before you can make a claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Head to RateCity&rsquo;s <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ratecity.com.au/superannuation"">superannuation comparison tool</a></span> to compare insurance policies offered by different super funds.</p>",,50,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,5.0,413.5

Taking the time to do some research and choose the best fund for your needs can have a big impact on your financial standing during retirement.</p>\n<h3>What is a superannuation fund?</h3>\n<p>Superannuation (commonly known as &lsquo;super&rsquo;) is money that&rsquo;s put aside and invested while you&rsquo;re working so you&rsquo;ll have money to live off when you retire. A super fund operates as a trust where your money is collected with other members' money and invested on your behalf by a trustee. Generally, you will not be able to access your super money until you retire.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re employed, your employer will make contributions to your chosen super fund on your behalf, and you can also make additional voluntary contributions of your own. If you&rsquo;re a low-income earner, the government may also make contributions to your super fund for you.</p>\n<h3>What are the types of superannuation funds?</h3>\n<p>Understanding the different types of super funds will make it easier to choose one that&rsquo;s right for you. Each superannuation fund falls into one of the following categories:</p>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>MySuper</strong></span></p>\n<p>MySuper funds are a replacement for existing default accounts offered by super funds. Your employer must pay your employer contributions into a MySuper account if you don&rsquo;t nominate a fund yourself. Different types of funds (such as industry funds and public sector funds) may offer MySuper accounts.</p>\n<p>MySuper accounts typically offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower fees</li>\n<li>Simple features so you don't pay for services you don't need</li>\n<li>Life insurance unless otherwise requested</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This type of fund allows you to manage your investments into two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single diversified investment strategy &ndash; Your money is put in a standard mix of investments with the same risk-reward approach for your whole life.</li>\n<li>Lifecycle investment strategy &ndash; Your money is moved from growth investments when you're younger to more conservative investments when you're older. This allows you to take on more risk when you&rsquo;re younger and can afford to wait out the peaks and troughs of the market.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Retail funds</strong></span></p>\n<p>Retail funds are commonly run by banks or investment companies, and they can usually be joined by anyone. The fund&rsquo;s shareholders expect to receive a return on their investment, and a percentage of the profits of these retail super funds goes to the shareholders. Common features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A large number of investment options, which could be beneficial if you want more control over where your money is invested</li>\n<li>Mid to high fees</li>\n<li>Usually accumulation funds</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Industry funds</strong></span></p>\n<p>Some industry funds are restricted to employees in a specific industry, whereas other larger funds are open to anyone. Common features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Operating as &lsquo;not-for-profit&rsquo;, which means any profits earned are invested back into the fund for the benefit of members</li>\n<li>Relatively low fees</li>\n<li>Low number of investment options, which may still be sufficient for the average person</li>\n<li>Usually accumulation funds</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Public sector funds</strong></span></p>\n<p>Most public sector super funds are only open to government employees. Common features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contributions above the required minimum, in some cases</li>\n<li>Low fees</li>\n<li>Profits put back into the fund for the benefit of members</li>\n<li>Defined benefits funds for some longer-term members, and accumulation funds for newer members</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Corporate funds</strong></span></p>\n<p>Corporate funds are set up by employers for employees and may have an employer who also operates the fund under a board of trustees. They can also be included as a separate part of a large retail or industry super fund. Common features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low to mid cost for big company funds, and a higher cost for smaller employers</li>\n<li>A wide range of investment options for those that are part of a larger fund</li>\n<li>Both defined benefits funds and accumulation funds</li>\n<li>A mix of not-for-profit and for-profit funds</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Eligible rollover funds</strong></span></p>\n<p>Eligible rollover funds (ERFs) are holding accounts for lost or inactive members with a low account balance. These funds vary in terms of fees and returns, and can be consolidated with active super funds.</p>\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Self-managed super funds</strong></span></p>\n<p>A self-managed super fund (SMSF) offers full control over where your money is invested. An SMSF is a private superannuation fund that you manage yourself, and is regulated by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>\n<p>These funds are generally only suitable for people with a thorough understanding of the financial and legal responsibilities of managing a super fund. Set-up and running costs can be expensive, so it&rsquo;s usually worth the cost only if you have a large balance.</p>\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the difference between accumulation funds and defined benefits funds?</h3>\n<p>Today, most types of superannuation funds are accumulation funds. They&rsquo;re called &lsquo;accumulation&rsquo; funds because your money grows over time. Factors affecting the value of your accumulation fund super include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your employer contributions</li>\n<li>Your voluntary contributions</li>\n<li>How much you receive in bonus contributions</li>\n<li>How much your fund earns from investing your super</li>\n<li>Fees charged</li>\n<li>Your chosen investment options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Defined benefit funds, on the other hand, are uncommon corporate or public sector funds. They&rsquo;re called &lsquo;defined benefit&rsquo; because you get paid a set amount (based on a formula) once you retire. Most defined benefit funds are closed to new members. Factors affecting your defined benefit fund super value include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your employer contributions</li>\n<li>Your voluntary contributions</li>\n<li>Your length of employment</li>\n<li>Your salary at retirement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In many cases, it&rsquo;s advisable to stay with a defined benefit fund rather than switching to an accumulated fund. However, every fund is different, so it&rsquo;s worth talking to a professional if you&rsquo;re part of a defined benefit fund and thinking about changing.</p>\n<h3>What happens to my super money?</h3>\n<p>Regardless of the type of fund you&rsquo;re a member of, your super money will be invested by your super fund&rsquo;s trustee. Investment options differ between funds, but usually include a mix of different asset categories, as well as single-sector options such as cash, property and shares.</p>\n<p>Returns on your investment will depend on the investment options you choose, so it&rsquo;s important to consider what&rsquo;s best for your circumstances. For example, if you&rsquo;re under 30, you might be willing to take on higher-risk investments and transition to more stable investments as you move towards retirement.</p>\n<p>When you retire, you can choose to access your super money as a lump sum, a regular income stream, or a combination of both.</p>\n<h3>How to choose a superannuation fund</h3>\n<p>When choosing a new super fund, consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The pros and cons of your current fund (if you have one)</li>\n<li>Your current financial standing</li>\n<li>The industry in which you&rsquo;re employed and the types of funds available to you</li>\n<li>Your knowledge of financial markets</li>\n<li>How long you have until retirement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every type of fund is different, so it&rsquo;s important consider the benefits and drawbacks of each given your circumstances. <span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ratecity.com.au/superannuation"">Compare superannuation funds</a></span> for your age, current super balance and preferences to find one that works for you.</p>",,70,0,3,2,150,0.5,0.15,0.15,0.1,0.1,22.75,318.0
